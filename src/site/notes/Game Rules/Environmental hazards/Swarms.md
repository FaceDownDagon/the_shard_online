Individual bees, mosquitos, or other similarly tiny creatures are usually not appropriate for modeling as a combat encounter. Instead, when these creatures gather in vast numbers, they may pose a hazard to adventurers. 

A swarm can cause distraction to those within. Affected characters must get one result point on a Willpower roll, or suffer [[Game Rules/Combat/Conditions\|distraction]] while they remain within the swarm.

If the swarm is composed of biting or stinging insects, the swarm can deal one point of bleed per turn, if so motivated. (Undisturbed bees, for example, might not sting, even if characters are within a swarm.)

Armor cannot prevent these effects, but heavy armor - or clothing which covers the whole body from head to toe - provides a one-turn buffer in which a character can enter the swarm without taking damage or being forced to roll against distraction. If they remain within after that, they suffer as usual.

Non-flying insects grant an additional turn of buffer to both armored and unarmored characters, as they have to crawl onto the victim.

Completely sealed specialty clothing, such as a beekeeper's uniform, can provide immunity to swarms, unless it is punctured.

A flying swarm can move at a rate of up to three tiles per turn. A ground-based swarm moves only one tile per turn.

Effects such as strong winds, smoke, or repellent scents can disperse a swarm, while area damage attacks such as fire can destroy them.
