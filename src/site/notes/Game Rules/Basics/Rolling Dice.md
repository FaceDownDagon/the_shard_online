The Shard is a d10 system. In this game, you roll a number of ten-sided dice (d10s) to determine the success or failure of most actions. Each roll of six or higher counts as a single 'progress point.' If you roll more progress points than an opposing character, or more than a set amount for certain environmental challenges, your action succeeds. If you roll fewer, your action fails. If you roll the same number, various things can happen, depending on the situation. 

When you perform any action, the number of dice you roll is based on your character's attributes and skill. For example, attempting to jump over a ravine would make you roll a number of dice equal to your character's Agility attribute. ([[Game Rules/Basics/Attributes\|Attributes]]) 

Rolls can be further modified by various circumstantial factors. These do not typically affect the number of dice rolled, but instead add or subtract a certain amount from each dice rolled. In the example above, if your character is fatigued from a forced march, you might take a -1 penalty on her Agility rolls. Your character's actual Agility score has not changed, but you'll need rolls that show a 7 or higher on the dice to get a progress. Bonuses and penalties can range from -5 (Automatic failure) to +5 (Automatic success with a number of progress points equal to the size of the dice pool.) 

The first d10 in any roll is called the 'leading die.' Keep track of the leading die by using a differently colored d10, or by using the leftmost result when using a digital die roller. Some rules will refer to this die. 

Lastly, it should be noted that extra progress points over what is needed for success are not wasted. Extra progress points, or 'edge', can be spent to add various effect to a successful attack or spell, and sometimes to other actions as well. A tied die roll can be considered as "zero edge", and a losing roll might be -1 edge or worse.
