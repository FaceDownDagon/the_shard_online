The Shard is a d10 system. In this game, you roll a number of ten-sided dice (d10s) to determine the success or failure of most actions. Each roll of six or higher counts as a single 'result point.' If you roll more points than an opposing character, or more than a set amount for certain environmental challenges, your action succeeds. If you roll fewer, your action fails. If you roll the same number, various things can happen, depending on the situation. 

When you perform any action, the number of dice you roll is based on your character's attributes and skill. For example, attempting to jump over a ravine would make you roll a number of dice equal to your character's Agility attribute. ([[Game Rules/Basics/Attributes\|Attributes]]) 

Rolls can be further modified by various circumstantial factors. These do not typically affect the number of dice rolled, but instead add or subtract a certain amount from each dice rolled. In the example above, if your character is fatigued from a forced march, you might take a -1 penalty on her Agility rolls. Your character's actual Agility score has not changed, but you'll need rolls that show a 7 or higher on the dice to get a point. Bonuses and penalties can range from -5 (Automatic failure) to +5 (Automatic success with a number of result points equal to the size of the dice pool.) In a few cases, the dice may be rolled even if success or failure is automatic, to determine secondary effects.

Lastly, it should be noted that extra result points over what is needed for success are not wasted. Extra points, or 'edge', can allow you to select more powerful outcomes, or add various effects to a successful attack or spell. A tied die roll can be considered as "zero edge", and a losing roll might be -1 edge or worse.
