Characters in the Shard have the following attributes, which govern what that character's areas of relative strength and weakness are.

**Strength** - Increases a character's hit points, governs most weapon damage (ranged and melee!), governs how much a character can lift or carry, and governs [[Game Rules/Combat/Grappling\|Grappling]]. Contributes to melee attack accuracy.
**Willpower** - Increases a character's hit points, improves [[Game Rules/Combat/Injury\|Injury]] threshold and ability to ignore pain, governs resistance to many debilitating and/or mental effects, and determines the raw amount of energy a mage can [[Game Rules/Magic/Magic, casting, & chanelling\|channel]] (but not their general magical skill.)
**Reflex** - Improves a character's movement-related capabilities and governs dodging attacks. Contributes to melee attack accuracy.
**Precision** - Governs ranged attack accuracy, governs stealth, and governs tasks involving precise hand movements. Contributes to melee attack accuracy.
**Attunement** - Governs most aspects of a character's ability to use magic to cast spells.

##### Derivative stats
The following additional stats can be derived from a character's attributes:
**Hit points (HP)** - Strength + Willpower + Base HP for size (given in race, but generally 5 for human-sized races)
**Melee attack** - (Strength + Reflex + Precision)/2.5, rounded down. Alternatively, use this table:

| Sum of Str+Ref+Prc | Melee attack |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| 5/6/7              | 2            |
| 8/9                | 3            |
| 10/11/12           | 4            |
| 13/14              | 5            |
| 15/16/17           | 6            |
| 18/19              | 7            |
| 20/21/22           | 8            |
**Injury threshold** - Maximum HP - (Willpower + 1)
