The Sphere of Earth concerns the magic of solid objects; especially stone, soil, and metal. Its disciplines are [[Game Rules/Magic/Earth/Seismism (discipline)\|Seismism]] and [[Game Rules/Magic/Earth/Construction (discipline)\|Construction]]. Its conjunctive disciplines are [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Wood (discipline)\|Wood]] and [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Pressure (discipline)\|Pressure]]. 

Seismism is "fast" earth magic, and is the most directly combative discipline. Users crack, shatter, shake, slide, and launch earth and stone, or sometimes other solid materials. 

Construction, meanwhile, is "slow" earth magic. It molds existing material into a desired shape, or even creates temporary "magecrystal" objects from nothing. It effectively offers instant combat engineering, as well as civilian uses - though fine detail is basically impossible, plowing, road-making, and other such tasks are usually done by earth mages. 

The conjunctive discipline between Earth and Blood is the discipline of Wood. Despite the name, wood magic manipulates the growth and shape of any sort of plant - not just trees. 

The discipline juxtaposed between the Sphere of Void and the Sphere of Earth is that of Pressure. These spells include gravity, suction, as well as the the ability to compress and temporarily shrink items. 

The focus component of Earth is hand and arm motions. With these, casting Earth magic becomes much easier.
