Scholars and sages have long debated the nature of magic. In its natural form, magic is entirely intangible, and can only be studied indirectly. Nonetheless, sorcerous tradition flourishes in the Shard, and mages ply their craft both in peace and in war. 

Some things can be said for certain. Magic energy permeates the world itself, but must be harnessed by the body to take form. The magical ability of a sorcerer or sorceress can be strengthened by practice, and the precision of the spells they render can be honed and refined. It is clear that something in the body itself allows for this - the veins of a mage suffering fatigue after extensive casting will often darken extensively - but accessing the ability for magic is less intuitive than learning how to control one's own muscles, and a fair bit more complex. 

It is possible, though uncommon, for children as young as eight to learn simple spells, and self-teaching is possible through extensive trial and error. However, as in any skill, those who wish to take their abilities beyond mere gimmicks and convenient charms typically apprentice under an experienced magi, or study in schools devoted to the magic arts. 

Another thing which rather strongly differentiates the practice of magic from physical training is the separation of various spheres - natural alignments of the user which restrict the nature of the magic they can access and use. These spheres are further divided into fifteen disciplines - two under each sphere, and five that are concurrent between two spheres each. This division of magic is thought to be a relic of the old world - an aspect of existence immutable by all but the most powerful deities, and as such, an unchanging aspect of the Shard. 

It should further be noted that each Sphere has a different mechanism by which mages typically concentrate on their spells. Though it is possible to circumvent these foci with training, most mages do not, as the foci themselves are rarely burdensome, and make the act of casting more stable. In the Sphere of Storm, for example, casting is assisted by chanting certain sounds and syllables.
