Infect a foe with a sickness of frailty that spreads to others when they drop.

**Major spell
Charge cost: 3
Single target
Range: 5
Attunement vs Willpower
Effect:** The target receives penalties based on the result of the opposed roll. 
- Negative edge: The disease lies dormant in the host. They take no penalties, but are still considered to be under the effect.
- Zero edge: The host takes one additional point of damage whenever they take damage. This additional damage is of the same type as the damage taken, or wounds if it's mixed-type damage.
- Positive edge: As zero edge, except the host takes additional damage equal to your edge, and also suffers a -1 penalty to all rolls.

Bleed converting to wounds does not cause additional bonus damage.

When the target drops, the contagion automatically attempts to spread to the nearest enemy. Treat this as if the spell was being cast from the location that the original target dropped, but it takes no action on your part.
**Duration: 3 turns. (Each new target also starts with a fresh 3-turn duration.)
