Infect the existing wounds of the target, causing further damage.

**Minor spell
Single target
Range: 3
Modified Attunement vs Willpower (See below)
Effect:** When casting Necrotize, the target's remaining hit points effect the roll: for each full quarter of their maximum health that the target is missing, add a +1 bonus to your roll. Targets at or above their maximum health are immune to Necrotize.

The target receives one wound per edge.
