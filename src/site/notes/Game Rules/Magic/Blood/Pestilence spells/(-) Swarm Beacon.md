Direct a swarm of lesser insects to a location of your choice, where they will bite, sting, or otherwise scourge your foes.

**Minor spell
Range: 5 tiles
Effect:** Cause nearby insects to congregate around the chosen point, if they can reach it. While you cannot stop the distraction aspect of the swarm, you may direct them to attack or not to attack creatures. These insects otherwise act identically to the [[Game Rules/Environmental hazards/Swarms\|Swarms]] hazard.
**Duration: Unlimited (Focus)**

Note: This spell actually requires a swarm of suitable insects or similar creatures - it does not create them. A jar filled with a colony of them is sufficient to create a one-tile swarm.
