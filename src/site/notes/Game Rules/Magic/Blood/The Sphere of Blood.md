The Sphere of Blood is comprised of magics which directly alter livings bodies. Its disciplines are [[Game Rules/Magic/Blood/Metamorphosis (discipline)\|Metamorphosis]] and [[Game Rules/Magic/Blood/Pestilence (discipline)\|Pestilence]]. Its conjunctive disciplines are [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Corrosion (discipline)\|Corrosion]] (with Fire) and [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Wood (discipline)\|Wood]] (with earth.) 

Metamorphosis is comprised of magics that alter the shape and function of living bodies. Some spells alter the body completely into that of another creature, while other cause only localized mutations. It should be noted that without special effort on behalf of the caster to 'anchor' a spell, such bodily adjustments are temporary - and even long-term spells must be maintained properly to avoid the heinous consequences of unchecked magic running throughout the body. 
Healing magics are also in this discipline, but beware! Over-saturation of magic in the body can cause unintended side effects which no mortal magic can remedy, so many shrewd healers will learn when to use more mundane methods when called for. 

Pestilence is the discipline concerned with toxins, diseases, and vermin. From miasmic clouds to directing swarms of mindless roaches, some of the more insidious spells of Pestilence have caused distrust of witch doctors to become one of the more common phobias in the Shard.

Corrosion magic governs acid, rust, and general entropy. It is perhaps the most purely destructive discipline of all fifteen, and excels at chewing through tough materials that are difficult to penetrate with conventional measures. 

The conjunctive discipline between Earth and Blood is the discipline of Wood. Despite the name, wood magic manipulates the growth and shape of any sort of plant - not just trees. 

The focus component of the Blood is material components. As long as the caster has a piece of organic matter on hand from a plant or animal with strong links to the spell being cast, casting magic becomes significantly easier for them.
