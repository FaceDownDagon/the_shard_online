The Sphere of Void, appropriately, includes magics of absence and undoing. Using this sphere, practitioners can wipe away light, magic, sound - even life. The disciplines in this sphere are [[Game Rules/Magic/Void/Purgation (discipline)\|Purgation]] and [[Game Rules/Magic/Void/Nightfall (discipline)\|Nightfall]]. The conjunctive disciplines are [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Frost (discipline)\|Frost]] and [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Pressure (discipline)\|Pressure]]. 

Purgation, to simplify slightly, is anti-magic, or magic meant to combat and destroy other magics: cleansing enchantments, warding areas against teleportation or trickery, etc. There are also spells that attack and drain the energy of another being.

Nightfall spells are those related to darkness, quietude, and stillness. A few spells in this discipline even delay the machinations of time itself.

The discipline juxtaposed between the Sphere of Void and the Sphere of Earth is that of Pressure. These spells include gravity, suction, as well as the the ability to compress and temporarily shrink items. 

Frost comprises spells related to the manipulation of ice and cold. It is considered a reasonably simple discipline to learn, but often sees less use than other energy-related disciplines by virtue of its more subtle applications. 

In the Sphere of Void, the focus component of casting is the use of complex glyphs, which can be written onto paper, or made of any material, so long as the pattern is correct.
