Spell attack keywords are similar to [[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon keywords\|Weapon keywords]], but typically only apply to spell attacks.
#### Attack modes 

**Ranged X:**Â This spell attacks as a ranged weapon, in the ranged attack phase, using Precision for the attack roll. It has an ideal range of X tiles and a maximum range of 2X tiles.

**Melee:** This spell attack is resolved as a Melee attack, in the melee attack phase, and uses the [[Game Rules/Basics/Attributes\|melee attack attribute]]. 

**Guided:** This spell attack is controlled directly by the caster's mind. It uses attunement for the attack roll, and resolves in the ranged attack phase.
#### Damage modes

**Bashing, cutting, thrusting, spiked:** Exactly as the [[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon keywords\|Weapon keywords]] of the same names.

**Toxic:** This spell attack deals all of its damage as [[Game Rules/Combat/Damage types\|Bleed]]. It takes the full normal penalty from enemy armor, unless another keyword alters this.

**Fire:** This spell attack deals half of its damage as [[Game Rules/Combat/Damage types\|Bleed]]. It ignores enemy armor entirely.

**Light:** This weapon does all of its damage as wounds. Reduce the damage penalty from enemy armor by half.

**Lightning/Frost:** This spell attack deals half of its damage as [[Game Rules/Combat/Damage types\|Shock]]. It ignores enemy armor entirely.

**Sonic:** This spell attack deals all of its damage as [[Game Rules/Combat/Damage types\|Shock]]. It ignores enemy armor entirely.

**... +X/-X:** When dealing damage using a mode with a numerical modifier, modify the roll by this amount.
#### Other keywords

**Liquid:** If this spell attack would normally be subject to an enemy armor penalty, reduce that penalty by half. (If the armor penalty was already half, reduce it by half again, rounding down; -2 would become 0, and -4 would become -1.)

**Energy:** This spell attack has no material substance. Characters who lack cover have a -2 penalty to their reflex rolls to defend energy attacks.

**Muscle:** This spell uses strength to calculate damage, rather than attunement.
