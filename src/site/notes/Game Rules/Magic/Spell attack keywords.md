Spell attack keywords are similar to [[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon keywords\|Weapon keywords]], but typically only apply to spell attacks.
#### Attack modes 

**Ranged X:**Â This spell attacks as a ranged weapon, in the ranged attack phase, using Precision for the attack roll. It has an ideal range of X tiles and a maximum range of 2X tiles.

**Melee:** This spell attack is resolved as a Melee attack, in the melee attack phase, and uses the [[Game Rules/Basics/Attributes\|melee attack attribute]]. 

**Guided:** This spell attack is controlled directly by the caster's mind. It uses attunement for the attack roll, and resolves in the ranged attack phase.
#### Damage modes

**Bashing, cutting, thrusting, spiked:** Exactly as the [[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon keywords\|Weapon keywords]] of the same names.

**Toxic:** This spell attack deals all of its damage as [[Game Rules/Combat/Damage types\|Bleed]]. Reduce the damage penalty from enemy armor by half.

**Fire:** This spell attack deals half of its damage as [[Game Rules/Combat/Damage types\|Bleed]]. It ignores enemy armor entirely.

**Light:** This weapon does all of its damage as wounds. Reduce the damage penalty from enemy armor by half.

**Lightning/Frost:** This spell attack deals half of its damage as [[Game Rules/Combat/Damage types\|Shock]]. It ignores enemy armor entirely.

**Sonic:** This spell attack deals all of its damage as [[Game Rules/Combat/Damage types\|Shock]]. It ignores enemy armor entirely.

**... +X/-X:** When dealing damage using a mode with a numerical modifier, modify the roll by this amount.
#### Other keywords

**Instant:** This spell attack happens instantaneously, leaving no time to respond. Characters have a -2 penalty to their reflex rolls to defend instant attacks.

**Energy:** This spell attack has no material substance. Characters have a -2 penalty to their reflex rolls to defend energy attacks.

**Flinch:** This spell attack inflicts a penalty to the victims attack rolls, spellcasting rolls, and willpower rolls to maintain focus. The penalty is equal to the shock damage dealt, and lasts until the end of this turn.

**Recharge X:** This property is normally found on biological attacks or magical artifacts. After an attack is made with a weapon with this property, another cannot be made during the following X turns.

**Persistent:** If an attack with this weapon successfully deals damage, you may roll damage again at the end of the next turn, but at a -1 penalty. This process repeats until either no damage is dealt, or an action is taken which logically eliminates the source of ongoing damage (for example, a burning character diving under water - the GM ultimately decides what qualifies.) The penalty compounds upon itself, so a third damage roll would be at -2, a fourth at -3, etc.
