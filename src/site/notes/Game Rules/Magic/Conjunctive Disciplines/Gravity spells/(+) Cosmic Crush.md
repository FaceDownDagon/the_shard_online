Forces the target to bear the weight of mountains, pinning them to the ground and smashing their flesh and bones.

**Major spell
Charge cost: 4
Single target
Range: 5
Attunement vs Strength
Effect:** The target receives damage and penalties based on the result of the opposed roll. 
- Negative edge: -4 penalty to movement, reflex rolls, and attack rolls. The penalty is reduced by 1 per negative edge. *(Example: at -1 edge, the penalties are -3 each.)* Ranged weapons have their range cut in half, rounded down.
- Zero edge: Immediately forced prone and paralyzed when this result occurs, but use the negative edge result for any further turns. *(This equates to a -4 penalty.)*
- Positive edge: Immediately forced prone and paralyzed. Inflict 1 wound per edge per turn.

Optionally, the caster can spend their action during the magic phase next turn to attempt a new roll, and applies that result if better.
**Duration: 2 turns (Focus)**
