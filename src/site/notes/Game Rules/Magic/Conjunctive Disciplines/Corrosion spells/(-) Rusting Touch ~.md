Rapidly corrodes a touched metal object, and can weaken armor.

Note: Normally, destructive spells don't interfere with the protective value of armor, since effects strong enough to break armor will kill the person inside long before the armor is negated. Because of its selective nature, Rusting Touch is an exception to this rule.
