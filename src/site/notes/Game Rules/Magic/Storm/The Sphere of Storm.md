The Sphere of Storm is composed of magics generally related to fluid motion. The disciplines under the Sphere of Storm are [[Game Rules/Magic/Storm/Flow (discipline)\|Flow]] and [[Game Rules/Magic/Storm/Sound (discipline)\|Sound]]. The conjunctive disciplines are [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Frost (discipline)\|Frost]] and [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Lightning (discipline)\|Lightning]]. 

Flow is the magic of wind and waves. Using Flow magic - also known locally by other terms such as Streamcraft, Flux, etc - one can manipulate air and water to produce gusts, currents, and vortices; to glide through sky or sea, and generally to manipulate most manners of gases and liquids. Flow magic cannot create matter, though; it creates nothing other than motion within an existing mass. 

Sound magic, obviously enough, is manipulation and creation of sound. Sound magic can equally be used to create a whispering voice at a great distance, or to create more potent and destructive forms of sound. 

Lightning is the creation and manipulation of electrical impulse. It is a bit more focused and destructive than Sound. 

Frost comprises spells related to the manipulation of ice and cold. It is considered a reasonably simple discipline to learn, but often sees less use than other energy-related disciplines by virtue of its more subtle applications. 

The focus component of the Sphere is Storm is voice. Storm mages can speak certain syllables in order to make the process of casting magic much easier for them.
