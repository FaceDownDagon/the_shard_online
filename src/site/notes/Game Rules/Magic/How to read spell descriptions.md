Example spell: [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Gravity spells/(+) Cosmic Crush\|(+) Cosmic Crush]].

***Major spell*** - Defines whether a spell is major or minor. ([[Game Rules/Magic/Spell types & chanelling\|Spell types & chanelling]])
***Charge cost: 4*** - Defines how much charge mist be expended to cast this major spell. Skipped for minor spells.
***Single target*** - Defines the area of area spells, or defines the eligible targets for targetted spells, or declares a spell as a spell attack. For spell attacks ([[Game Rules/Magic/Casting spells\|Casting spells]]), the following two entries are skipped.
***Range: 5*** - Defines how near the caster must be to the target to cast this spell. Distance is measured to the point of origin for area spells.
***Attunement vs Strength*** - Defines the caster's roll and the opponent's roll, respectively. If the spell does not directly affect foes, this entry will instead say "Utility." Utility spells roll Attunement unopposed, and are cast successfully as long as the caster scores at least one result point.
***Effect:*** *"The target receives damage and penalties based on the result of the opposed roll...(etc)"* - Explains what the spell does - damage, beneficial or harmful modifiers, etc. Spell attacks will instead have a "Profile" entry that defines that spell attack's keywords.
***Duration: 2 turns (Focus)*** - Some spell lack a duration: they simply apply their effect at the time of casting. For spells with a duration, it defines how long the spell's effect stays in place. "Focus" indicates that the spell requires the ongoing concentration of the caster: the caster makes a Willpower roll against any wounds or shock taken (including when bleed damage becomes wounds over time.) If they fail to get result points equal to or greater than damage taken, the spell effect ends at the end of the current phase. If the caster drops, the spell also ends.
Spell duration does not include the turn in which the spell was cast.
Focus spells can be voluntarily ended by the caster for free at any time.
It is entirely possible for a mage to cast two or more focus spells at the same time. In that case, a failed Willpower roll against damage causes *all* focus spells cast by that mage to end.
