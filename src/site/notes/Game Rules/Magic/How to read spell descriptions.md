Example spell: [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Pressure spells/(+) Cosmic Crush\|(+) Cosmic Crush]].

***Major spell*** - Defines whether a spell is major or minor. ([[Game Rules/Magic/Spell types & chanelling\|Spell types & chanelling]])
***Charge cost: 6*** - Defines how much charge mist be expended to cast this major spell. Skipped for minor spells.
***Single target*** - Defines the area of area spells, or defines the eligible targets for targetted spells, or declares a spell as a spell attack. For spell attacks ([[Game Rules/Magic/Casting spells\|Casting spells]]), the following two entries are skipped.
***Range: 5*** - Defines how near the caster must be to the target to cast this spell. Distance is measured to the point of origin for area spells.
***Attunement vs Strength*** - Defines the caster's roll and the opponent's roll, respectively. If the spell does not directly affect foes, this entry will instead say "Utility." Utility spells roll Attunement unopposed, and are cast successfully as long as the caster scores at least one result point.
***Effect:** "The target receives damage and penalties based on the result of the opposed roll...(etc)"* - Explains what the spell does - damage, beneficial or harmful modifiers, etc. Spell attacks will instead have a "Profile" entry that defines that spell attack's keywords.
***Duration: 2 turns (Sustained)*** - Defines how long the spell's effect stays in place. "Sustained" indicates that the spell effect ends if the caster is incapacitated. "Channeled" Indicates that the spell requires the ongoing concentration of the caster: the caster makes a Willpower roll against any wounds or shock taken (including when bleed damage becomes wounds over time.) If they fail to get result points equal to or greater than damage taken, the spell effect ends.
Spell duration does not include the turn in which the spell was cast.
