In the Shard, spellcasting does not use a system of recharging resources. Instead, spells are divided into two categories:  
**1:** Minor spells, which can be used at any time.  
**2:** Major spells, which require the user to enter a channeling state and build up a certain amount of charge before being cast. As the name implies, these spells have greater effects than minor spells.

At any time, a character capable of casting any major spell can enter the **channeling state**. During the channeling state, a character can build Charge. Charge is consumed to cast major spells. 

Charge is predominantly accrued passively at the end of each turn while in the channeling state. The base rate is one per turn, though certain boons can increase that amount. You can only hold charge for as long as the channeling state lasts - maintaining this state of heightened magical activity is taxing! 

The channeling state lasts for ten turns, and the maximum charge a character can hold at one time is equal to their [[Game Rules/Basics/Attributes\|Willpower]]. Once the channeling state ends, you'll be fatigued for a while, and unable to enter the channeling state again. (This does not correspond to an exact time frame, but generally, it is for the remainder of any urgent scene. Entering a channeling state many times per day will cause long-term exhaustion.)

When taking damage during channeling, you'll have to make a Willpower roll or lose charge: Subtract the number of result points you got on your Will roll from the damage, and lose charge points equal to the remainder. Charge cannot drop below zero.
