To cast a spell, a character rolls [[Game Rules/Basics/Attributes\|attunement]]. Whether the spells is successful depends on the following:

- For spells that don't directly affect foes, one [[Game Rules/Basics/Rolling Dice\|result point]] is typically enough for the spell to be cast. Other aspects of the spell, such as duration, may be dependent on the result, though - refer to the spell description.
- Some spells will grant the caster a type of magical attack. Spell attacks deal damage based on the caster's attunement, rather than strength, unless indicated otherwise. The caster may immediately make one attack this way, and on future turns, may follow the typical rules for [[Game Rules/Combat/Attacking\|Attacking]]. These kinds of spells may possess a mixture of [[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon keywords\|Weapon keywords]] and [[Game Rules/Magic/Spell attack keywords\|Spell attack keywords]].
- Spells which directly affect opponents, but aren't attacks, will cause an opposed roll - usually the caster's attunement vs the target's willpower. The spells description will then list which effects the spell has at various levels of edge.

If the caster cannot perform the focus component of their [[Game Rules/Magic/The Five Spheres of Magic\|sphere of magic]], their attunement roll to cast suffers a -2 penalty.

Any further information about the spell will be clarified in the spell's description.
