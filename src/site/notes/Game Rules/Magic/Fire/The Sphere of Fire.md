The Sphere of Fire consists of the disciplines of [[Game Rules/Magic/Fire/Heat (discipline)\|Heat]] and [[Game Rules/Magic/Fire/Light (discipline)\|Light]]. The conjunctive disciplines of Fire are those of [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Lightning (discipline)\|Lightning]] (shared with [[Game Rules/Magic/Storm/The Sphere of Storm\|The Sphere of Storm]],) and [[Game Rules/Magic/Conjunctive Disciplines/Corrosion (discipline)\|Corrosion]] (shared with [[Game Rules/Magic/Blood/The Sphere of Blood\|The Sphere of Blood]].) 

Heat is rather self-explanatory, being the creation and manipulation of heat and flame. The discipline of Heat considered one of the easiest forms of magic to learn - while direct comparisons with other spheres is difficult due to exclusionary sphere alignment, students can reach a usable level of skill within the span of a day, in some cases. 

The discipline of Light, similarly, is the ability to create and manipulate the namesake element. Experienced users of this discipline can not only brighten a dark room, but create vivid animated glamers in any shape or color. 

Lightning is the creation and manipulation of electrical impulse. Being a type of energy that is generally deleterious to living beings, it is often compared to the Heat discipline, but Lightning typically offers more precision, where Heat excels in widespread damage - though there is still significant overlap. 

Corrosion magic governs acid, rust, and general entropy. It is perhaps the most purely destructive discipline of all fifteen, and excels at chewing through tough materials that are difficult to penetrate with conventional measures. 

The focus component of the Fire Sphere is daylight. Fire mages access their spells far more easily when there is natural light.
