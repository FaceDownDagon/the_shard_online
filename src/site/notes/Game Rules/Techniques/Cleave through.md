(This is an Overkill technique, and requires the [[Game Rules/Boons/Overkill\|Overkill]] boon to learn.)

When you overkill a foe in melee, if another foe is within melee range, you may immediately make a special attack roll against the target nearest to the incapacitated foe. The target has a - 2 penalty to their reflex roll against this attack. You may use this attack roll only to Smash, Drive Back or Deal Damage, and when you roll damage, roll dice equal to the excess damage from your overkill instead of your full Strength. 

This process may repeat.

Types: Martial, Melee, Overkill
