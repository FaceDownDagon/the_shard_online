Techniques represent different actions or options your character can choose from, typically in combat (though not always.)

Your character's techniques are their toolbox. They aren't passive bonuses that make your character stronger, but rather, they expand the breadth and variety of what your character is capable of.

Technically, all spells are techniques, but for organizational purposes, they are categorized under Magic. This folder will contain all non-spell techniques.

 Some techniques possess various types. This simply means that they are eligible choices when a class grants you a technique of that type.
