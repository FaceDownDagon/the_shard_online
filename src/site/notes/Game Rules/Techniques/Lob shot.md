Instead of making a ranged attack as normal during the ranged phase, you may select a tile within ideal range of one of your ranged weapons, and fire a high arcing shot at that location. This counts as making a ranged attack, but don't roll yet. If there is a character standing in that tile at the end of the movement phase, roll your ranged attack against them. This roll takes a -2 penalty, but only consider cover that is directly above either you or your target for this attack.

You may use this technique to target tiles that are completely obscured from your position.

Whether this technique works with ranged spell attacks depends on whether those spell attacks are affected by gravity - this is a GM call, but generally, spell attacks that lack the "[[Game Rules/Magic/Spell attack keywords\|energy]]" keyword should qualify.
