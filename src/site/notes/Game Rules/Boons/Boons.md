Boons provide permanents bonuses to various aspects of your character, such as improved charge rate for spellcasting, improved mobility and atleticism, and improved powers of perception, amongst many others.

Boons do not need to be specifically activated - their bonuses apply automatically under the relevant circumstances.

Your character will gain boons at certain levels, as described in their class progression table.

Some boons possess various types. This simply means that they are eligible choices when a class grants you a boon of that type.

Some boons are marked with the special "attribute" type. These boons mimic some of the functionality of one or more primary [[Game Rules/Basics/Attributes\|Attributes]]. Whenever your character would be able to gain a boon, if they would be able to choose a boon with the "attribute" tag, they may instead trade in one of their "attribute" boons to increase the associated attribute by 1. For example, a character with the [[Game Rules/Boons/Attribute boons/Vigor\|Vigor]] boon would be able to trade it in to increase her Strength OR Willpower by one, since Vigor has the tag "Attribute (Strength/Willpower)". (She loses the Vigor boon; it has been 'upgraded' to an attribute point.)
