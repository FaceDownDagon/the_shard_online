When fighting with two (or more) weapons, you do not need to choose which weapon you are using at the time of attacking. Instead, the following rules apply:
- Your reach is the highest reach amongst weapons you are wielding.
- You gain all defensive benefits of both weapons, though you still cannot benefit from the same keyword multiple times.
- If one or more weapons you are wielding have different bonuses or penalties to attack, use the better of the two. This does not limit your ability to use the other weapon for the results of this attack - for example, you could attack with a rapier, and use the rock in your other hand to actually deal damage.
- If using two of the same weapon, gain [[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon keywords\|swift]] on both. If they already have swift, they gain sweeping instead. (You still cannot benefit from the same keyword multiple times.)
