While in the [[Game Rules/Magic/Spell types & chanelling\|channeling state]], you may make an additional Attunement roll at the end of each turn, after gaining the baseline +1 charge for the turn. Apply a penalty to this roll equivalent to your armor's penalty to damage. If your result points on this roll exceed your current charge, gain another +1 charge. (Do not exceed your maximum charge.)

Types: Magic
