The following is a short list of common weapon types. Note that each entry is a category of weapon with many individual variations, some of which might be known by different names in different parts of the world. For example, a curved sword used for slashing attacks might be called a saber, a scimitar, a cutlass, a talwar, or other names depending on the region and culture, but they are generally similar to one another in function.Â Information on weapon keywords can be found here: ([[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon keywords\|Weapon keywords]])
