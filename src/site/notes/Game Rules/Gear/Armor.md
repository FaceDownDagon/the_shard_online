There are two basic categories of armor: light armor, and heavy armor. Light armor might be a padded gambeson or a brigandine vest. Heavy armor might be a complete suit of metal plate, or full-body lamellar.

Light armor applies a -2 penalty to enemy damage rolls against the wearer. It causes a -1 penalty to swim rolls and rolls against environmental heat. 
Light armor can be put on with one action.

Heavy armor applies a -3 penalty to enemy damage rolls against the wearer. It causes a -2 penalty to stealth rolls and rolls against environmental heat, and a -4 penalty to swim rolls and rolls against exhaustion.
With [[Game Rules/Boons/Heavy Armor Training\|Heavy Armor Training]], the penalty to enemy damage rolls improves to -4, and the penalty to rolls against exhaustion is reduced to -2.
Heavy armor requires ten turns worth of actions to put on.
