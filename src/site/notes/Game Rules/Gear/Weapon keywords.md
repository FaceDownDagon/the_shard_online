#### Handedness

**One-handed:** This weapon is wielded in one hand.

**Two-handed:** This weapon is wielded in both hands, and has a +1 bonus to dealing damage.

**One-and-a-half-handed:** This weapon can be wielded as if it were one-handed or two-handed, at the wielder's discretion. While wielded in two hands, it has a +1 bonus to deal damage, and the swift keyword.

**Half-handed:** The hand that this weapon is in can still grip and hold other objects, but cannot effectively wield another weapon.

**Non-handed:** This weapon is used with a body part other than the hands, and therefore leaves the hands free.

#### Draw type

**Draw -X:** This weapon can be drawn to hand and used to attack in the same turn. The attack suffers a -X penalty.

**Held/secured:** This weapon is too large to be stored in a way that is readily accessible. Either the wielder keeps the weapon in hand, puts it down, or ties it to their back in a way that takes an entire miscellaneous action to draw.

**Always available:** This weapon is part of the wielder's body. So long as the associated limbs are available (not wielding other weapons), this weapon can be used.

**Worn:** This weapon is part of the wielder's armor. So long as they are wearing the associated armor, and the associated limbs are available, this weapon can be used.

**Grabbed:** This improvised weapon is typically seized from the environment, rather than kept on one's person. If at hand, a potential wielder can pick it up and attack with it in a single turn, but the GM determines the penalty for doing so, based on the item's position. Weapons without this quality can be grabbed in the exact same way, if they are laying loose in the environment.
Guidelines: 
Weapon at waist height: -1 
Weapon on the floor: -3 (or -1 if prone)

#### Damage modes

Damage modes represent the part of any weapon that actually hurts the foe. There are four damage modes that can result in three damage types: Thrusting, cutting, bashing, and spiked. It is not necessary to select one of these modes until such a time as you are about to deal damage. A few [[Game Rules/Techniques/Techniques\|Techniques]] will require a weapon that has a specific damage mode to be available on your weapon.

**Thrusting/Spiked:** This weapon can deal piercing damage. When dealing piercing damage, the penalty to your damage roll from enemy armor is cut in half, but half of your damage (rounded down) is dealt in the form of [[Game Rules/Combat/Damage types\|bleed]]. The difference between thrusting and spiked is only relevant to certain techniques and other rules, but there is no difference at baseline. *(Thrusting weapons deal their piercing damage via thrusts, while spiked weapons are swung in an arc, like a pickaxe.)*

**Cutting:** This weapon can deal cutting damage. Cutting is the simplest form of damage: 100% of your damage is dealt as normal wounds, and you take the full normal penalty to your damage roll from enemy armor.

**Bashing:** This weapon can deal bashing damage. When dealing bashing damage, the penalty to your damage roll from enemy armor is cut in half, but half of your damage (rounded down) is dealt in the form of [[Game Rules/Combat/Damage types\|shock]]. 

**... +X/-X:** When dealing damage using a mode with a numerical modifier, modify the roll by this amount.

#### Reach

**Reach X:** The [[Game Rules/Combat/Combat Turn Order\|order]] in which melee combat is conducted is determined by the weapon reach of the highest reach weapon each character is holding: higher reach goes first.
#### Other keywords

**Brace:** When using this weapon, if either you or the enemy moved two or more tiles towards the other this turn, add a +1 bonus to your damage rolls on thrusting attacks this turn. If eight or more tiles were moved in a direct line, add +2 instead.

**Hooked:** This weapon can hook your opponent or their weapons. If you [[Game Rules/Combat/Attacking\|snag]] a foe, you don't take a penalty to your grapple role for lacking free hands, and you may choose to end the grapple for free after your grapple action is resolved.

**Sturdy:** This weapon has a foolproof construction. It has doubled hit points, and cannot incur breakage complications by attacking ([[Game Rules/Gear/Gear health & complications\|Gear health & complications]]).

**Throwing X:** This weapon is balanced and aerodynamic, such that it can be thrown effectively (used as a ranged attack.) Throwing weapon have an ideal range of X tiles and a maximum range of 2X tiles.

**Barbed:** This weapon is designed to stick inside foes or their shields. It has a much greater chance to become stuck ([[Game Rules/Gear/Gear health & complications\|Gear health & complications]]).

**Innocuous:** This item is so mundane that it is often allowed where obvious weapons are not, and rarely arouses suspicion. No strict mechanical effect.

**Parrying:** This weapon is of above-average usefulness for defending against melee attackers. It grants a +1 bonus reflex rolls against melee attacks (but not ranged attacks.)

**Sweeping:** This weapon has a large striking area, better allowing a combatant to repulse multiple foes. The wielder reduces their reflex penalty for being outnumbered by one, to a minimum of zero.

**Swift:** This weapon is balanced and nimble, allowing for accurate strikes. It doubles the effect of [[Game Rules/Combat/Attacking\|feinting]].

**Concealable:** This weapon is small, and can be hidden on the wielder's person.

**Attached:** This weapon is either part of the wielder's body, or affixed to the wielder in such a way as it cannot easily be dropped. It cannot be disarmed.

**Blocking:** This weapon or shield excels in defense. The wielder gains a +1 bonus to reflex rolls to defend against all attacks.

**Cover:** This shield offers a large protective barrier to hide behind. The wielder has permanent cover against ranged attacks.

**Multihold X:** A character can hold X of this weapon in a single hand, but cannot attack effectively while holding multiple unless otherwise stated.

**Missile:** This weapon fires a very fast projectile. Characters who lack cover have a -2 penalty to their reflex rolls to defend missile attacks.

**Ranged X:** This is a dedicated ranged weapon. If a character uses this weapon in melee, do not use this profile; instead, model it as an appropriate [[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon list\|Improvised weapon]]. This weapon has an ideal range of X tiles and a maximum range of 2X tiles.

**Prone use:** This weapon can be used without penalty while [[Game Rules/Combat/Conditions\|prone]].

**Entangling:** When thrown, this weapon can snag an opponent's gear or body. {It does stuff/placeholder.}

#### Negative keywords

**Awkward:** This item is simply not meant as a melee weapon, and has properties that make it poor for such use. It has a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls.

**Innaccurate:** This weapon is not precise and consistent as a ranged weapon. It has a -1 penalty on ranged attack rolls.

**Reloading (various):** This weapon must be reloaded in a way that is separate from its use to attack. Reload (fast) does not require an action to reload, but the reload only occurs if the user has their other hand free during the miscellaneous actions portion of the [[Game Rules/Combat/Combat Turn Order\|Combat Turn Order]]. Reload (X actions) means that the user must spend 1 action during the miscellaneous actions portion of the combat turn order X times before the weapon is reloaded. Reload (X actions+movements) is similar, except that the user can only make progress on reloading if they did not move during that turn.

**Tiny:** This weapon's small size makes it much less deadly. It has a -1 penalty on all damage rolls.

**Vulnerable:** This weapon is a living part of the wielder's body, or leaves the user's body exposed during use. If damage would be dealt to this weapon, instead resolve that damage against the wielder at a -1 penalty.

**Unbalancing:** This weapon is overly commital, allowing for opponents to make easy counterattacks. After attacking with this weapon, the wielder suffers a -1 penalty to reflex rolls until the start of the next turn.

**Unwieldy:** This weapon is long or bulky enough to require a planted stance to use properly. Take a -1 penalty to attack on any turn where you moved more than a single tile.

**Fragile:** This weapon is more susceptible to breaking than usual. It has only a single hit point, and a greater chance to incur a breakage ([[Game Rules/Gear/Gear health & complications\|Gear health & complications]]).
