Injury, in the context of rules, is when a character has taken enough damage to be below half of their maximum HP.

When this occurs, the character is considered "injured" until they have time to heal. While injured, a character cannot become injured a second time. While injured, a character becomes susceptible to certain additional effects or penalties inflicted by their foes.

Generally, characters can see whether their opponents are injured.
