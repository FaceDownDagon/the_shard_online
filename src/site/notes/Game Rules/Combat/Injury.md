Injury, in the context of rules, is when a character has taken enough damage to be at or below a threshold determined by their [[Game Rules/Basics/Attributes\|Willpower]] - the higher their Willpower, the more damage can be taken before crossing this threshold.

When this occurs, the character is considered "injured" until they have time to heal. While injured, a character cannot become injured a second time. While injured, a character loses their bonus to resist spells and techniques with the "finisher" property.
