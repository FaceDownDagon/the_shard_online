In combat, if you deem certain enemies to be utterly unthreatening - or certain tactical opportunities too vital - you may entirely forfeit your ability to make reflex rolls defending against one or more of those enemies. By doing so, you may treat that foe as if they didn't exist in regards to [[Game Rules/Combat/Conditions\|Outnumbering]] and any [[Game Rules/Combat/Movement\|Movement]] that does not directly pass through their tile.

You may alter this choice at the beginning of any turn, before movement, and at no other time.
