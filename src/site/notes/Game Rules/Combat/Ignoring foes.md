In combat, if you deem certain enemies to be utterly unthreatening - or certain tactical opportunities too vital - you may take a -4 penalty to your reflex rolls defending against one or more of those enemies. By doing so, you may treat those foes as if they didn't exist in regards to [[Game Rules/Combat/Conditions\|Outnumbering]] and any [[Game Rules/Combat/Movement\|Movement]] that does not directly pass through their tile.

You may alter this choice during the movement phase, and at no other time.

If you exit a tile that is adjacent to a foe this way, if that foe has not yet taken a non-movement action this turn, that foe may choose to immediately make their melee attack against you, instead of waiting for the melee phase. (This still counts as their action.)
