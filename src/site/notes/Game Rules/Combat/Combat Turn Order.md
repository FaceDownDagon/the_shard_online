When playing a combat scenario in the Shard, the actions of players and foes can be broken down into several phases, which occur in the following order:

1 - Ranged attacks
2 - Movement
3 - Melee attacks
4 - Magic casting
5 - Miscellaneous actions

Unless a rule states otherwise, each character can act in one of these phases, plus the movement phase. Each phase is summarized below in more detail.

1 - Ranged attacks. Characters can make attacks with ranged weapons, or weaponlike ranged spells. This phase can be resolved simultaneously - damage and effects from ranged attacks are resolved after all ranged attacks are resolved.
Instead of making an attack immediately, a character may instead elect to declare overwatch, storing their ranged attack for when (and if) selected enemies enter some declared area during movement.
See [[Game Rules/Combat/Attacking\|Attacking]] for more information. 

2 - Movement. Characters reposition themselves across the battlefield. This phase is resolved in order of Agility.
Instead of moving normally, a character may instead declare intercept, moving in reaction to selected enemies to engage and block their movement into a declared area. {Intercept is experimental.}
See [[Game Rules/Combat/Movement\|Movement]] for more information.

3 - Melee attacks. Characters trade blows with close-ranged weaponry. This phase is resolved in order of weapon reach. However, the DM can elect to resolve attacks within any entire group of engaged creatures before moving on to other groups, so long as this obeys weapon reach order for any characters engaged with one another.
See [[Game Rules/Combat/Attacking\|Attacking]] for more information. Most [[Game Rules/Combat/Grappling\|Grappling]] occurs here, after other attacks have resolved.

4 - Magic casting. Characters utilize their spells to effect the battlefield. If a character took damage this turn, before this phase, they may suffer penalties to their ability to channel magic this turn. 
See [[Game Rules/Magic/Spell types & chanelling\|Spell types & chanelling]] for more information.

5 - Miscellaneous actions. Any combat actions not included in another category occur here. This may include actions such as pulling an item from a pack, applying first aid, or operating a siege engine, though it is not limited to such things.
