When playing a combat scenario in the Shard, the actions of players and foes can be broken down into several phases, which occur in the following order:

1 - Active defense
2 - Ranged attacks
3 - Movement
4 - Melee attacks
5 - Magic casting
6 - Miscellaneous actions

Unless a rule states otherwise, each character can act in one of these phases, plus the movement phase. Each phase is summarized below in more detail.

1 - Active defense. A character can commit their action for the turn to focus solely on defense. If they do, they gain a +1 bonus to reflex rolls and willpower rolls to avoid attacks and spells.

2 - Ranged attacks. Characters can make attacks with ranged weapons, or weaponlike ranged spells. This phase can be resolved simultaneously - damage and effects from ranged attacks are resolved after all ranged attacks are resolved.
Instead of making an attack immediately, a character may instead elect to declare overwatch, storing their ranged attack for when (and if) selected enemies enter some declared area during movement.
See [[Game Rules/Combat/Attacking\|Attacking]] for more information. 

3 - Movement. Characters reposition themselves across the battlefield. This phase is simultaneous, and conflicting desires are resolved based on which character has more movement left over. A character can commit their action for the turn to run during this phase, increasing their movement range by 50%.
Instead of moving normally, a character may instead declare intercept or avoid, moving in reaction to selected enemies.
See [[Game Rules/Combat/Movement\|Movement]] for more information.

4 - Melee attacks. Characters trade blows with close-ranged weaponry. This phase is resolved in order of weapon reach. However, the DM can elect to resolve attacks within any entire group of engaged creatures before moving on to other groups, so long as this obeys weapon reach order for any characters engaged with one another.
See [[Game Rules/Combat/Attacking\|Attacking]] for more information. Most [[Game Rules/Combat/Grappling\|Grappling]] occurs here, after other attacks have resolved.

5 - Magic casting. Characters utilize their spells to effect the battlefield. This phase can be resolved simultaneously - damage and effects from spells are resolved after all spells are resolved.
See [[Game Rules/Magic/Spell types & chanelling\|Spell types & chanelling]] for more information.

6 - Miscellaneous actions. Any combat actions not included in another category occur here. This may include actions such as pulling an item from a pack, applying first aid, or operating a siege engine, though it is not limited to such things. Withdrawing from melee combat also occurs here.
