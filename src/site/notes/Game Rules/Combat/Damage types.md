Damage comes in three varieties in the Shard: Wounds, bleed, and shock.

**Wounds** represent 'normal' damage. When a character takes wounds, that many hit points are removed immediately, and there is no other lingering effect.

**Bleed** represents ongoing damage. Bleed damage does not immediately remove hit points. Instead, at the end of a character's turn, that character loses 1 HP + 1 additional HP per 10 bleed that character is suffering, up to a maximum of the amount of bleed that they have. Then, they reduce their bleed by the same amount.
Although it is named bleed, other effects that deal damage slowly over time may cause bleed damage, such as toxins.

**Shock** represents disruption to a character's vitals. Shock doesn't cause a character to lose hit points on its own, but while a character has any shock, they are treated as if their hit points were that much lower. This CAN cause a character to fall below the [[Game Rules/Combat/Injury\|injury]] threshold, or even die. However, as long as the character is alive, at the end of their turn, they remove 1 shock + 1 additional shock per ten shock they are suffering.

Whenever a character is suffering from shock and bleed simultaneously, shock and bleed should be removed at a 1:1 ratio and replaced by regular wounds. This replacement is not, in itself, considered an additional instance of damage occuring for the purpose of other rules.
