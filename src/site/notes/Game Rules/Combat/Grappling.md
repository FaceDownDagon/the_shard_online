Grappling occurs after an [[Game Rules/Combat/Attacking\|attacking]] character has selected to Enter a Grapple with a foe.

Grappling is resolved via opposed Strength rolls. Unless stated otherwise, grapple rolls are made at the end of the melee portion of the [[Game Rules/Combat/Combat Turn Order\|Combat Turn Order]]. The character who began the grapple acts first, and then the other character(s).

Unless you initiated the grapple this turn with a [[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon keywords\|hooked]] weapon, you get a -2 penalty on your grapple rolls if you do not have a free hand (or the equivalent.) However, you may drop one or more items in your hands for free before making your grapple roll.

Based on the result of the roll, select one of the following results that you match or exceed the associated [[Game Rules/Basics/Rolling Dice\|edge]] requirement of:

**Zero edge:**
- Escape: The grapple ends.
**One edge:**
- Takedown: Both you and the opponent become prone.
- Drag: Cannot be used if prone. You may move one tile. You may then move your opponent one tile, but they must end adjacent to you.
- Pummel: Make a melee attack, with the exception that the reach of your weapon is subtracted as a penalty from your attack roll, and your opponent suffers a -2 penalty to their reflex roll to defend. (You cannot use the result to initiate another grapple.)
**Two edge:**
- Throw: You must be standing to use this option. Place your opponent prone in any adjacent space of your choice, and optionally, end the grapple.
- Wrest: Seize an item from your opponent's hands, or at the GM's discretion, from somewhere else accessible on their body. If you have a hand free, you may hold it, otherwise, it is dropped in an adjacent square of your choice.
- Pin (prone opponent): Dominate your opponent's movement, applying a stacking -1 penalty to their grapple rolls until the grapple ends, or they succeed on their own roll to Pin. Requires your opponent to be prone. You can apply an additional -1 penalty for each additional Edge you achieve beyond what is necessary to Pin. If your opponent's penalty reaches -5, such that they can no longer resist, additional uses of Pin can be used to knock the enemy unconscious and/or bind them in restraints, such as rope or manacles.
**Three edge:**
- Pin (standing opponent): As above, but does not require opponent to be prone.
