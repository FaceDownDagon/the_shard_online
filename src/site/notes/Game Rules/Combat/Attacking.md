Attacking in the Shard comes in two major varieties: ranged, and melee. Ranged attacks are made by rolling Precision opposed by the target's Reflex. Melee attacks are made by rolling [[Game Rules/Basics/Attributes\|Melee Attack]], also opposed by the target's Reflex.

Ranged attacks are subject to a -1 penalty if the target is beyond ideal range (but within max range.) Any attack is subject to a further -1 if the target is behind cover.

After rolling an attack, the attacker has many options, depending on the amount of [[Game Rules/Basics/Rolling Dice\|edge]] they rolled. Select one of the following results that you match or exceed the associated edge requirement of:

**Negative edge:**
- Jockey: Move one tile one tile of your choice away from your foe, to either side, or to the diagonals in between.
**Zero edge:**
- Feint: If you attack the same foe next turn, they have a -1 penalty on that reflex roll.
- Ward off: The foe has a -1 penalty on its next attack against you this turn. (Useless if your foe attacks before you in the [[Game Rules/Combat/Combat Turn Order\|Combat Turn Order]])
- Smash: Roll damage, but directly against the opponents' blocking weapon, not the opponent.
- Enter a grapple (Melee only): You close in tightly with your opponent, opening up a slew of new options based on an opposed Strength roll. See [[Game Rules/Combat/Grappling\|Grappling]]. You do not get a grapple roll this turn.
- Drive back: You may force your opponent to move one tile of your choice away from you, to either side, or to the diagonals in between. They may decline to do so, but if they do, you may instead roll damage against them.
**One edge:**
- Deal damage.
- Enter a grapple, and immediately make a grapple roll. (Melee only)
- Execute a zero edge attack option, then jockey.
**Two edge:**
- Deal damage, then execute a zero edge or less attack option.
- Execute any two zero edge or less attack options.
**Three edge:** 
- Deal damage, ignoring enemy armor.
