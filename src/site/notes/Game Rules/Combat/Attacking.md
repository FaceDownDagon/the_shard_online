Attacking in the Shard comes in two major varieties: ranged, and melee. Ranged attacks are made by rolling Precision opposed by the target's Reflex. Melee attacks are made by rolling [[Game Rules/Basics/Attributes\|Melee Attack]], also opposed by the target's Reflex. 

Ranged attacks and ranged damage are subject to a -1 penalty if the target is beyond ideal range (but within max range.) Ranged attacks are subject to a further penalty if the target is behind cover - see [[Game Rules/Combat/Cover\|Cover]] for how much of a penalty various types of cover apply. Finally, if a character makes a ranged attack while enemy characters are already in melee distance, that character suffers a -3 penalty to their reflex rolls to defend against each such opponent this turn.

After rolling an attack, the attacker has many options, depending on the amount of [[Game Rules/Basics/Rolling Dice\|edge]] they rolled. Select one of the following results that you match or exceed the associated edge requirement of:

**Negative edge:**
- Jockey: Move one tile of your choice to either side of your foe, maintaining your current distance.
**Zero edge:**
- Feint (Melee only): If you attack the same foe next turn, they have a -1 penalty on that reflex roll. (-2 with a [[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon keywords\|swift]] weapon.)
- Dial in (Ranged only): If you attack the same foe next turn and they moved one tile or less, you gain a +1 bonus on that attack roll.
- Ward off (Melee only): The foe has a penalty on its next attack against you this turn, equal to the difference in reach. (Useless if your foe attacks before you in the [[Game Rules/Combat/Combat Turn Order\|Combat Turn Order]].)
- Smash: Roll damage, but directly against one of the opponents' weapons, not the opponent. (If the opponent has no weapons with which to defend themself except those with the vulnerable keyword, roll damage against the opponent at a -1 penalty.)
- Enter a grapple (Melee only): You close in tightly with your opponent, opening up a slew of new options based on an opposed Strength roll. See [[Game Rules/Combat/Grappling\|Grappling]]. You do not get a grapple roll this turn.
- Drive back: You may force your opponent to move one tile of your choice away from you, to either side, or to the diagonals in between. They may decline to do so, but if they do, you may instead roll damage against them.
**One edge:**
- Deal damage.
- Snag: Enter a grapple, and immediately make a grapple roll. (Melee only)
- Execute a zero edge attack option, then jockey.
**Two edge:**
- Execute a zero edge or less attack option, then deal damage.
- Execute any two zero edge or less attack options.
**Three edge:** 
- Deal damage, ignoring enemy armor.


To deal damage, a character rolls their Strength unopposed. This roll is modified by [[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon keywords\|Weapon keywords]] and enemy [[Game Rules/Gear/Armor\|Armor]].

If, for any reason, a character would deal damage to an opponent twice in the same attack roll, instead, they deal damage once at a +2 bonus.
