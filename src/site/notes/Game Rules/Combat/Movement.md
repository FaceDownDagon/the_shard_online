The default movement rate of most humanoid characters is 4 tiles per turn. Each tile represents two meters.

Certain tiles may contain terrain that impedes movement - each such tile counts as two tiles for the purpose of movement. Other tiles may require [[Game Rules/Combat/Climbing, Swimming and Leaping\|Climbing, Swimming and Leaping]].

When using normal movement, if you are adjacent to a foe or become adjacent to a foe, you cannot move any further. Other movement, like [[Game Rules/Combat/Attacking\|jockey]], specifically ignores this restriction. Additionally, you may [[Game Rules/Combat/Ignoring foes\|ignore foes]].

A character can instead choose to declare to intercept at the beginning of the movement phase. Intercept is similar to overwatch, but for movement. If you do, select some area that you are capable of moving adjacent to with a normal movement. When an enemy enters this area, you may immediately move to be adjacent to them, halting their movement. 

If you didn't move or declare to intercept during the movement phase, you may instead make a withdraw movement during the Miscellaneous phase. A withdraw movement is like a normal movement, except you may also move directly away from one or more foes until you are no longer adjacent to them.
