The default movement rate of most humanoid characters is 4 tiles per turn. Each tile represents two meters.

A character can commit their action for the turn to run during this phase, increasing their movement range by 50% of their base movement rate, rounded down.

Certain tiles may contain terrain that impedes movement - each such tile counts as two tiles for the purpose of movement. Other tiles may require [[Game Rules/Combat/Climbing, Swimming and Leaping\|Climbing, Swimming and Leaping]]. The type label given next to a races' base movement rate can effect some of these secondary movement modes, but does not generally affect their movement in open terrain.

When using normal movement, if you are adjacent to a foe or become adjacent to a foe, you cannot move any further. Other movement, like [[Game Rules/Combat/Attacking\|jockey]], specifically ignores this restriction. Additionally, you may [[Game Rules/Combat/Ignoring foes\|ignore foes]].

You can declare a specific tile you wish to move to, or a specfic character you wish to move in relation to. You may instead choose to declare to intercept or avoid at the beginning of the movement phase. 
Intercept is similar to overwatch, but for movement. If you do, select some area that you are capable of moving adjacent to with a normal movement. When an enemy enters this area, you may immediately move to be adjacent to them, halting their movement. 
To avoid, select some number of enemies and a distance. If possible, you will move such that you are that far from the closest selected foe, and if not, you will move such that you are the farthest possible distance from the closest selected foe.

Since movement is simultaneous, it may occur that some characters have mutually exclusive declared movements. Examples include one character attempting to move adjacent to a character trying to avoid them, or two characters trying to move into the same tile. When this occurs, first resolve any part of movement that doesn't conflict. Then, whichever character has more tiles of movement remaining to use at that point is 'faster,' and gets their preferred result. If both characters have the same amount of movement remaining, the GM may decide that neither character gets their preferred result (if it is possible to do so in a 'symmetrical' way), or may decide that the characters make opposed Reflex rolls until there is a winner, with the winner getting their preferred result.

If you didn't move or declare to intercept or avoid during the movement phase, you may instead make a withdraw movement during the Miscellaneous phase. A withdraw movement is like a normal movement, except you may also move directly away from one or more foes until you are no longer adjacent to them.
