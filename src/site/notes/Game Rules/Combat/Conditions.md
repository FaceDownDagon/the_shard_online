Here are some of the conditions may befall your character during combat, and their effects. {Partial/incomplete list!}

**Prone:** Lying on the ground. Going prone grants cover against ranged attacks. However, a prone character makes most attacks at a -2 penalty, and suffers a -2 penalty to reflex rolls. A prone character's movement is reduced to one tile. A character can choose to go prone at the end of their movement, diving to the ground. To stand from prone, a character can use their movement, unless they were knocked prone by an enemy effect during the preceding turn.

**Outnumbered:** If a character is in melee range of multiple enemies, they may be outnumbered. Count the number of such enemies. Then, for each ally including yourself, you may subtract from the calculation one enemy which that ally is within melee range of. If this number is greater than zero, you take that number as a penalty to your reflex rolls to defend against melee attacks.
