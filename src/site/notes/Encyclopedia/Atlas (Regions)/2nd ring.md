As one moves away from [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Worldseat\|The Worldseat]], the worst of the mutation and corruption tapers off, leading to saner environments just unusual enough to be uncanny. Known as the Savage Ring, monsters still abound here, though most start to obey the laws of nature as we know them. Roaming bands of mongrel-kin live here, in scattered tribes, but few would call anything in the second ring 'civilization.' It is a lawless, chaotic place, where only the strongest survive for long.
