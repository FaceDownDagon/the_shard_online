The fourth ring - also called the Temperate Ring - is equidistant from the world's center and its edge, and is the ring most like the world most of us know. Due to the balance between life and barrenness, between madness and stillness, it is the ring most heavily populated by mortals, and as such is the most heavily claimed by various nations. While the conditions are considered by many to be ideal, the high value of living space in this ring can lead to quarrels and wars, the grip of merchant guilds, and all the burdens of society. Even here, no place is paradise.
