The fourth ring - also called the Temperate Ring - is equidistant from the world's center and its edge. Little corrupt magic seeps this far into the world, yet plenty of ley energy courses through the land, feeding the processes that maintain a healthy ecosystem. Due to these balanced conditions, it is the ring most heavily populated by mortals, and as such is the most heavily claimed by various nations. While the conditions are considered by many to be ideal, the high value of living space in this ring can lead to quarrels and wars, the grip of merchant guilds, and all the burdens of society. Even here, no place is paradise.
