As we continue to depart from theÂ [[Encyclopedia/Locations/The Worldseat\|The Worldseat]], we begin to more clearly see the consequences of lands deprived of vitalizing energies. The Barren Ring is a harsh, empty place - vast sandy deserts, naked stone, desolate ice. Some creatures still scrape out their meager living here, with even a few remote exile clans eking out an existence. Indeed, while magic and life fade, untouched mineral veins and ancient ruins of the days where [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht]] still roamed can be found in these parts. Still, any travelers best be prepared for lonesome journeys with little chance to resupply.
