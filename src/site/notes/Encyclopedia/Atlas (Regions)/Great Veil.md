The Great Veil is a curtain of warding magic that separates the Shard from the place it was stolen from, [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Infinite Garden\|The Infinite Garden]]. It was created by [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht]] himself to ward out his mother, [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Azamathra\|Azamathra]], and keep the Shard hidden from her sight. No mortal has seen it, but the [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Demigod\|demigods]] attest to its existence.
