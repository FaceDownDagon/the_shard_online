The Shard is a fragment of [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Infinite Garden\|a larger creation]], cut off and plundered by aÂ [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|mad god]], and [[Encyclopedia/Locations/Great Veil\|isolated beyond hope of return.]]

It is also the name of both the system and setting of the tabletop role-playing game you are currently reading about!

The part of creation stolen by the Mad God is collectively known as the Shard. Taking the form of a massive, hollow disc, the Shard is a region about 4200 kilometers across and 20 kilometers high. The sky is actually capped by a stony 'ceiling,' studded with crystals that shine daylight on a cycle. At the center of the disc is [[Encyclopedia/Locations/The Worldseat\|The Worldseat]], the prison and tomb of the now-comatose god who was deposed at the height of his madness. The latent magic he emanates in his slumber defines many of the environmental conditions on the Shard, and due to that influence, the Shard is usually mapped out in seven concentric rings, based on their proximity. Most mortals live within the middle rings; close enough to the Seat to be fertile, but far enough to avoid the worst of the monsters and corruption.
