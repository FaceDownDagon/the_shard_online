You might also just know it as 'the world.' But in reality, the Shard is only a fragment of the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Infinite Garden\|The Infinite Garden]], cut off and plundered by a [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|mad god]], and separated by the [[Encyclopedia/Locations/Great Veil\|Great Veil]].

The part of creation stolen by the Mad God is collectively known as the Shard. Taking the form of a massive, hollow disc, the Shard is about 4200 kilometers across and 20 kilometers high. The sky is actually capped by a stony 'ceiling'. At the center of the disc is the Worldseat, which defines many of the environmental conditions on the Shard. Due to the heavy influence of the Worldseat, the Shard is usually mapped out in seven concentric rings, based on their proximity. Most mortals live within the middle rings; close enough to the Seat to be fertile, but far enough to avoid the worst of the monsters and corruption.

The rings:
[[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/1st ring\|1st ring]]
[[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/2nd ring\|2nd ring]]
[[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/3rd ring\|3rd ring]]
[[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/4th ring\|4th ring]]
