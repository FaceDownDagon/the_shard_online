The last of the 'civilized rings', the Tranquil Ring is perhaps the simplest. Here, there's enough food and magic to sustain society, if only through constant labor and careful stewardship. Life here often seems to be in a permanent autumn of sorts, with dry scrublands, sparse forests, and cold steppes. Monsters are rare this far out, but roving gangs of bandits and raiders are a significant threat in their stead.
