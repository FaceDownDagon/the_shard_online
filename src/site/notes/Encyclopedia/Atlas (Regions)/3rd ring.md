At last we come to the first of the so-called 'civilized' rings. The Vivid ring, as its name suggests, is lush, verdant, and wild. Often compared to the fever-dreams of faerie domains, the life here is oft still strange and wondrous, as are the inhabitants. Dangers still lurk, but are just tame enough for actual cities and towns to form. Food is plentiful, but life in this ring often presents other challenges, as nature is quick to swallow up what mortals carve out for themselves.
