Underneath the surface of the Shard lies a complex, highly interconnected system of caverns and tunnels, collectively cslled the Underpaths. In most regions, most of these are largely barren, save those closely connected to the surface. However, the closer one draws to [[Encyclopedia/Locations/The Worldseat\|The Worldseat]], the more these caves host a variety of magic-eating organisms which can sustain life without ever seeing the light of day.

Certain races, like [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Oklin/Antrulins\|Antrulins]], are specifically adapted to subterranean life, while others, such as [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Nuriliths\|Nuriliths]], are equally at home on the surface or deep below. The Underpaths are also home to the powerful hive entities known as [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Intelligent Monsters/Deep Mothers\|Deep Mothers]].
