The lands closest to [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Worldseat\|The Worldseat]] are classified as the Nightmare Ring, due to the overwhelming presence of hostile, corrupted creatures, and twisted, unnatural flora creating ecosystems utterly inimical to mortal settlement. Few expeditions have been made this close to the Seat, and those that return tell tales of forests made of writhing flesh, miasmic fog filled with floating fungus, and pools of gelatinous ooze teeming with swarms of maggot-fish. Still, magic is at its strongest here, and the powers flowing within this place entice many who seek to harness it to their own ends.
