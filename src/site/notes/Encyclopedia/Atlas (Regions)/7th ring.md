At the furthest edges of the world, one enters the Dead Ring. Nothing lives here; at least not permanently, as this zone is so bereft that its very substance has frayed away. There are places here with no air to breath, no water to drink; places where magic itself fails, and places where the very ground has crumbled away. Rumor states that even the rules of time hold little definitive grasp here, as unfortunate visitors wander without purpose until simply fading out from the real. 

At the far edge are the walls of the world; the borders of the Shard, and beyond them the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/Bitter Sea\|bitter astral sea]] - equally unfit for mortal life, but marginally more stable. Only those who seek answers go here; for at the edge of the world driftsÂ [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Usen-Ai\|Usen-Ai]], escaping from the cares of existence, and the [[Encyclopedia/Locations/Great Veil\|Great Veil]] that obscures the Shard from ever coming back into the [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Azamathra\|the goddess']] fold.
