The Infinite Garden is the plane of existence ruled over by the goddess [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Azamathra\|Azamathra]]. The shard was torn from the Garden about three hundred years ago, so some tales and memories of the Garden still exist. According to [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Jagrith\|Jagrith]], the Garden is a pet project of Azamathra's that she uses to farm power, but is generally a decent place to live. It is known that the Infinite Garden, like its namesake suggests, is larger than the Shard by orders of magnitude. The entire plane is infused with life energy of a level similar to the innermost rings of the Shard, but without the corrupt influence of a mad god's fitful nightmares.
