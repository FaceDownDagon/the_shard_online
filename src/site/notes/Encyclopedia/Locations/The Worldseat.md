At the center of the world of the Shard lies its most important feature: the Worldseat. The prison of the Mad God [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht]], this is where he slumbers, dormant. Life and magic emanate from him, but are equally at risk of being corrupted by his spiteful nightmares. The Worldseat manifests as a huge, twisted pillar of stone and flesh, often weeping strange streams of magmatic nectar.
 
While the gigantic structure is visible from most of the inner rings, relatively little is known about it, due to the corrupting influence of Golyaht spawning incredible numbers of hostile monsters and unforgiving environs in the surrounding areas of the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/1st ring\|1st ring]].
