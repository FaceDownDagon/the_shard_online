Suddebrach is a relict feudal kingdom located in the southwestern Shard, straddling significant sections of the third and fourth rings. It is an old nation, predating its seizure into the Shard by hundreds of years. 

However, the old nobility of Suddebrach has slowly lost much of their former power to the rising influence of the merchants and guilded craftsmen which form the institution known as [[Encyclopedia/Organizations/The Oxcart League\|The Oxcart League]]. While the nobility still has the prestige of legacy, owns large tracts of land, and directly commands the royal army, the League effectively bankrolls Suddebrach. This leverage makes lawmaking a negotiated venture at best, and most nobles are ill-positioned to oppose League initiatives.

Suddebrach is a fairly diverse region, with large populations of [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Nyxies\|Nyxies]], [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Nuriliths\|Nuriliths]], and [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Lao Kesh\|Lao Kesh]], and significant numbers of [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Oklin/Orogi\|Orogi]] and [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Dryads/Hazewreaths\|Hazewreaths]] as well. While the royal family and a majority of nobles are Kesh, many positions of nobility were historically by appointment, so various different noble houses come from the different constituent races. For example, the northwestern province is traditionally a Nyxie population center due to the sapphire mines providing desirable stones for reproduction, and likewise has long been governed by a Nyxie duchess, [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Specific named mortals/Nirita Fane\|Nirita Fane]].
The current king of Suddebrach is [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Specific named mortals/Jans Zolle\|Jans Zolle]], who rules from the capital city of [[Encyclopedia/Locations/Kalum Karon\|Kalum Karon]].
