The Orogi Inner Legions are a decentralized democratic militaristic society, populated by [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Oklin/Orogi\|Orogi]]. The Inner Legions occupy a zone in the western portion of [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/3rd ring\|3rd ring]].  The territory is mountainous, and semi-tropical cloud forests are the most widespread environment.

In the Legions, military service is compulsory for all able-bodied adults. Both government and military are structured upon the "rule of eight." Every group of eight soldiers forms a squad, and whenever the squad needs to makes its concerns known to higher levels above them, they select a single candidate, who then goes on to form another group of eight with other individuals who have been similarly selected. Likewise, this second-level group of eight can send up one individual to the third level, and so on and so forth, all the way up to the Council of Eight, which is the highest level of authority. Commands similarly flow down the hierarchy from the council level, all the way to the squad level.
