The Iron Order is a group led by [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Haldos\|Haldos]] that teaches utmost discipline and obedience. It is equal parts a training dojo and a political faction. The Order is deeply tied to the teachings of Haldos, and his unwavering dedication to preserving the ongoing existence of the Shard.  
  
The core tenets of the Iron Order are as follows:  

1. The world gives life to the self.
2. The self exists only as a part of the world.
3. The needs of the self are subservient to the needs of the world.
4. Discipline and obedience are the tools by which the self can align to the needs of the world.
5. That which applies to the self, applies also to the other.
6. Those who can receive the truth quickly may be shown the truth gently.
7. Those who turn from the truth will receive the truth harshly.

 The majority of the Iron Order live and train in the fortress-monastery at [[Encyclopedia/Locations/Mikil Agi\|Mikil Agi]]. However, Iron Order members who advance beyond their initial training might be assigned missions throughout the Shard.
