The Oxcart league is an organization of craftsmen and merchants that operates in the nation of [[Encyclopedia/Organizations/Nation-states/Suddebrach\|Suddebrach]]. While originally just a caravan security service, the league has become the dominant economic power in Suddebrach, and a major institution in politics as well. It is an open secret that League coffers dwarf the royal treasury, and thus, League backing has become essential for those seeking to begin any sort of major project within the nation.

While the League does not officially command a military force, it has been noted by many cynical individuals that League security guards operate in far greater numbers than necessity would imply. Officially, the Oxcart League maintains cordial relations with Suddebrach nobility, but there is no shortage of agents who work to increase the influence of the former at the cost of the latter. While a few nobles have become keen to this dynamic and are attempting to retain their base of influence, they remain the exception, rather than the norm.
