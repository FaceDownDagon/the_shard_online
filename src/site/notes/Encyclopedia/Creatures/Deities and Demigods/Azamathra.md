Azamathra is the primary goddess and ruler of [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Infinite Garden\|The Infinite Garden]]. According to [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Jagrith\|Jagrith]], she is significantly more powerful than [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht]], by a wide margin, but she herself despised being called a [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/God\|god]]. Interestingly, Jagrith has also proposed that Azamathra's nature is not, in fact, like Golyaht's at all, but rather that she is an exceedingly old and absurdly powerful [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Intelligent Monsters/Demons/Blood Demon\|Blood Demon]] who consumed her entire home plane of existence ([[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/Ancient Hell\|Ancient Hell]]). However, juxtaposing this, he also professes her to be quite affectionate and motherly towards her creations, almost to the point of being smothering.

Azamathra's influence on the Shard is essentially nullified due to the existence of the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/Great Veil\|Great Veil]].
