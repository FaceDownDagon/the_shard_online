Jagrith has the appearance of a feral, chimerical creature, with the legs and body of a lizard, a four-armed humanoid torso, a furred draconic head, and a whip-like tail with a magma-filled sting at the tip. While he is now Sovereign of Flame, his true nature was originally as a spirit of Blood - a lord of wild beasts and untamed magics. Subjected to a mutilation of his essence to fulfill the balance of the stolen world, he became cynical of [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht]]'s leadership earlier than any of the other six [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Demigod\|demigods]]. Surly and bitter at shattered promises, it is mostly through him that we know the stories of what came before. His abode is under a plateau in a rocky shrubland in the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/5th ring\|5th ring]], where he sometimes accepts travelers, but always rejects potential devotees.
