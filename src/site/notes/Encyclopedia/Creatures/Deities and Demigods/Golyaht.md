Golyaht, the Tyrant, the Mad God, is the only true deity present within the Shard. A megalomaniac at heart, he created (or rather, stole) the Shard in a bid to become the supreme deity of his own world. Only a bit more than a decade later, the [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Demigod\|Demigods]] who were his accomplices, and the mortals who he had kidnapped, rose against him and imprisoned him in [[Encyclopedia/Locations/The Worldseat\|The Worldseat]] for his hubris and abuse. To this day, he remains comatose but dreaming there.
