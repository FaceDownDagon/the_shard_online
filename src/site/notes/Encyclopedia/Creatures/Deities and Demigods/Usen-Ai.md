Usen-Ai, the dreamer, is a placid creature resembling a floating, owl-faced serpent with a multitude of diaphanous fins. He banished himself to theÂ [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/Bitter Sea\|Bitter Sea]] outside the outermost ring of the Shard, removing himself almost completely from its machinations. Occasionally, a desperate individual looking for answers will journey to the edges of the shard to seek the wisdom of his manifold prophetic visions, but even those who make it to that desolate place often fail to find him.

Usen-Ai manages the leylknes underpinning [[Game Rules/Magic/Void/The Sphere of Void\|The Sphere of Void]].
