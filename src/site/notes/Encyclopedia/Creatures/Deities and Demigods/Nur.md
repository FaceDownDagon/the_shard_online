A former symbol of renewal and fertility, Nur turned to hedonism after the imprisonment of the [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Mad god]]. Now grown massive and bloated, she never leaves her court on the seatward border of theÂ [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/2nd ring\|2nd ring]]. On one side, revelous pilgrims engage in all manner of indulgences, and Nur's visage is between that of a fetching woman and a devouring locust. Wedged into a cavern behind her, however, a massive, pale, grub-like tail extends for hundreds, if not thousands of meters, its distended mass constantly growing and festering away, feeding a vast and corrupted underground ecosystem. Though capable of brief bouts of lucidity and even wisdom, petitioners can rarely pull her attention away from the endless parade of empty pleasures.

Nur manages the leylines underpinning [[Game Rules/Magic/Blood/The Sphere of Blood\|The Sphere of Blood]].
