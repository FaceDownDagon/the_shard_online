Harkunon has the appearance of an alabaster humanoid male, with a flowing beard, and wearing a loose robe that subtly blows with the personal wind that he generates. His face, however, is smooth and featureless, lacking the eyes, nose, and mouth.

Rather than managing one of [[Game Rules/Magic/The Five Spheres of Magic\|The Five Spheres of Magic]] like the other [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Demigods\|Demigods]], Harkunon acts as the Arbiter of the Shard - a neutral judge and ambassador for hearing the concerns of mortals, as well as the other demigods, for assuring their contentment, and for mediating their conflicts. Increasingly, however, he has abandoned the former duties in favor of the latter, and has adopted a policy of aloof non-interference for any concerns below the level of nations.
