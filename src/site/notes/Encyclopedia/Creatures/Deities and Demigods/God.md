Within the greater universe of the Shard, a god refers to a being with the power to create matter, energy, and life from nothing. ([[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Intelligent Monsters/Demons/Demons\|Demons]] may possess some of these powers, but not all of them at once.)

A god may or may not have any religious significance, depending on how they wish to be treated, and gods occupy the physical universe and possess bodies. No known god has ever died, and it is unclear whether they actually can, though some of the [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Demigod\|demigods]] believe that it is possible.

[[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Azamathra\|Azamathra]] is the mother of all known gods, and is far more powerful than any of her children; it is thought that only she can change the nature of [[Game Rules/Magic/The Five Spheres of Magic\|The Five Spheres of Magic]], for example. [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht]], meanwhile, is the only god present within the Shard.
