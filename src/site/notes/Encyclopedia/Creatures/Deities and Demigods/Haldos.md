While his official title remains the Lord of Stone and Earth, Haldos is more often known by a different title in the current age: The Lord of [[Encyclopedia/Organizations/The Iron Order\|the Iron Order]]. Although Haldos, like the other demigods, recognizes the failure of Golyaht's leadership, Haldos alone still believes in the original plan of the stolen world - he simply places himself at the helm. Teaching his followers fanatical discipline and obedience, he makes his home in the fortress-temple at [[Mikil Agi\|Mikil Agi]], in the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/4th ring\|4th ring]]. There, he is as much a part of the ramparts as he is his own being, possessing the appearance of a vast, broad golem with a mask-like face.
