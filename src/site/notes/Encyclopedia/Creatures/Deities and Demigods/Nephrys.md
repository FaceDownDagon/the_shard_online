Unlike the other demigods, Nephrys does not possess one uniform, unchanging appearance. She takes the general visage of a humanoid female, but can manifest herself as a hazy, ethereal mass of air, a swirling mass of water, or a lightning-touched mass of clouds.

Hoping that the Shard can still be reunited with [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Infinite Garden\|The Infinite Garden]], Nephrys will seek out promising individuals, whispering tales of heroism and valor to them, and attempting to guide them to complete tasks she believes will aid this goal - though its unclear if this is the case. As often as not, however, her aid creates local lords and celebrities who use her patronage as a jumping-off point.

Nephrys manages the leylines underpinning [[Game Rules/Magic/Storm/The Sphere of Storm\|The Sphere of Storm]].
