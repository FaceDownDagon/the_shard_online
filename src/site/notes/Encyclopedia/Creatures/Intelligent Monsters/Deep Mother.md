Deep Mothers are a race of social insects that primarily live underground. A single Deep Mother Queen is a hulking, mantis-like insect with a bloated abdomen, and front claws adapted for digging instead of for capturing prey. The species is named after this caste; deep mother queens produce the various drones which in turn serve multifarious functions. 

Bewilderingly, however, a Deep Mother Queen is only one part of a Deep Mother individual (albeit the most important part.) A Deep Mother's consciousness is not limited to a single body, but is rather a singular consciousness operating many bodies at once. A Deep Mother IS her drones, just as much as she is the Queen. It is possible for this united conscious to split or even perish when the primary Queen body is lost, but even this can be endured, as 'lady-in-waiting' caste drones are typically prepared to grow into Queens just for such an event.

Deep Mothers are immaculate users of [[Game Rules/Magic/Blood/The Sphere of Blood\|Blood magic]], and can craft new castes of drones just as easily as a mortal might craft an item out of wood or stone. That being said, a list of some common drone types is described below, though it cannot possibly be comprehensive. 

- **Queen caste:** Primary reproducer. Seems to be more important to anchor a Brood Mother's consciousness and sense of self than any other caste. The Queen is also the most potent magic-user of any caste, possessing abilities that easily rival [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Intelligent Monsters/Dragons/Dragons\|dragons]].
- **Lady-in-waiting caste:** Immature queens kept in reserve, in case something befalls the current Queen.
- **Packet caste:** Male drones used for breeding. Most of a Deep Mother's children are born asexually; however, different Deep Mothers will trade Packets with one another when they desire to intentionally spawn a new Deep Mother consciousness through a fresh, unlinked Queen.
- **Weaver caste:** Nest-builders. Responsible for maintaining subterranean tunnels, which they line with silk.
- **Harvest caste:** Collect organic matter from the surface to haul underground, to use as compost.
- **Gardener caste:** Grow fungus from the organic matter brought in by the Harvest caste, which is the primary food source used by a Deep Mother.
- **Diplomat caste:** When a Deep Mother feels the need to communicate with mortals, she will spawn a drone that possesses humanoid vocal chords to talk with them. They live for only as long as is necessary, before returning to the Queen to be consumed.
- **Trinket castes:** Being intelligent creatures, Deep Mothers will sometimes create drones which serve no other purpose than to display artistic patterns, or to create music, or to spray perfume-like pheromones...the forms a trinket drone can take are as limitless as the Deep Mother's creativity.
- **Greeting & Gourmand caste:** Deep Mothers create greeting drones to offer to each other on the rare occasions that they meet. They have only one function - to be eaten be a similarly specialized Gourmand drone, which is equipped with a sense of taste many times stronger than what is otherwise necessary for most creatures.
- **Lockjaw caste:** One of the more common military castes, Lockjaws are simple brute fighting machines, meant to clamp down on an enemy's limb or body and to never let go.
- **Slimer caste:** These small, simple military drones are little more than a sac of chemical glue on legs. They spit their namesake slime at enemies, which becomes harder and stickier when exposed to air.
- **Injector & Bladeworm caste:** The Injector caste possess a specialized 'stinger' which is actually more like an ovipositor, depositing loads of gnawing, parasite-like Bladeworm drones directly into the flesh of an enemy.
- **Avatar caste:** A military drone made to resemble the appearance of the Queen, but with all of her reproductive organs replaced with stronger sinews, heavier plated armor, and more terrifying claws. This caste can also use Blood Magic quite effectively in combat.

As one might imagine, Deep Mothers are incredibly powerful, with a single Deep Mother's power often being comparable to that of a small nation. This has led to many unfortunate conflicts, as a Deep Mother's sense of morality is deeply shaped by her multi-body state of being. A Deep Mother who has not dealt regularly with mortals often fails to fully comprehend their concerns over things like love and death. Due to their primarily subterranean existence, though, many Deep Mothers are quite isolated from the concerns of the surface world.
