Djinni are technically a classification of fleshy, anemone-like polyp creatures. However, djinni are much better known as the magical projections they use to feed and interact with the world. Djinni are fully intelligent creatures, and through their projections, can speak with others - usually in their own unique language.

While most djinni are very powerful in their magical avatar form, their biological body is virtually helpless. For this reason, a djinn is usually incredibly reserved and protective regarding the location of its true body polyp - colloquially referred to as a 'pot' or 'lamp' by some mortals - and should it be found, it will do its best to appease the creature at whose mercy it finds itself. While djinni can vary widely in personality - both across individuals as well as across species - this possibility of exploitation deeply colors the way they interact with non-Djinni, and even with eachother. It can manifest as reclusiveness, hostility, or deceit, and many djinn develop complex, multi-layered strategies for self-preservation. Traps, decoys, misdirection and even fortification are all common methods.

The most common variety of Djinn is the 'Cloudbreak Djinn,' a desert djinn that stays dormant during dry weather, but awakens to feed during the brief wet season. These djinn stay buried under dry soil or sand most of the time, curling into a hardened ball that only reconstitutes when exposed to rain. They are the easiest type of djinn for mortals to collect and capture, so most make their homes far into the depths of the desert to avoid this fate.

Other types of djinn include the territorial cave-dwelling Pale Prince Djinn, the symbiotic (and uncharitably named) Dragon's Broom, and the enigmatic Tower Djinn, which confounds scholars to this day as to the purpose of its consistently empty spire 'nests.'
