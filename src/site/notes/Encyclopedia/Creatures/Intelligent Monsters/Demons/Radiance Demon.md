As with all [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Intelligent Monsters/Demons/Demons\|Demons]], radiance demons are immensely powerful denizens of another world, but luckily are exceedingly rare. Any demon encountered in the Shard is a hitchhiker from the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Infinite Garden\|The Infinite Garden]], though they originated in [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/Ancient Hell\|Ancient Hell]].

A radiance demon's particular strength is _absolute energy._ A radiance demon is a walking furnace akin to the core of a star. They can create energy from nothingness, typically in the form of a beam of hot plasma. This ability does not convert ambient magical energy - it creates it. While the distinction may seem minor, it means that a radiance demon can use its abilities freely in places where the leylines that undergird magic have frayed and dissolved, such as dead magic zones in the outer rings, or the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/Bitter Sea\|Bitter Sea]]. 

This also means that much like [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Intelligent Monsters/Demons/Earth Demon\|Earth Demons]], radiance demons have few external needs, so while they can be killed, they can exist in perpetuity in very inhospitable places. These traits, in conjunction, makes them a theoretical last source of magical energy in the event that [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht]] dies, according to certain eccentric scholars.
 
Their emissions and/or attacks can be intensified to any degree. However, doing so takes time and concentration, and extreme discharge can cause blowback, or vaporize the ground under their feet, etc. So, in practical terms, a radiance demon's power output depends on how long it can focus before being killed or forced to give up. This still allows for massive, devastating attacks on a scale unlike what almost any other beings can produce, however.
 
The typical radiance demon is imperious, boastful, and narcissistic. Occasionally, mortals have treated with them non-violently, but this requires cultish levels of praise and devotion to the radiance demon - an arrangement that is not easily terminated.
