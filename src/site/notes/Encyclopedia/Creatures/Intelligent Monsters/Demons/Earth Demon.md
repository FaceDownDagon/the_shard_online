As with all [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Intelligent Monsters/Demons/Demons\|Demons]], earth demons are immensely powerful denizens of another world, but luckily are exceedingly rare. Any demon encountered in the Shard is a hitchhiker from the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Infinite Garden\|The Infinite Garden]], though they originated in [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/Ancient Hell\|Ancient Hell]].

An earth demon's particular strength is _absolute invulnerability._ Earth demons are impervious to every known kind of weapon and magic, and even to divine attacks. An earth demon cannot be killed by any means whatsoever, no matter how destructive and dramatic. 

In addition, earth demons are incredibly strong (though not infinitely strong) and as such, are very difficult to contain. Despite this, containment is the only real option to address an earth demon other than avoiding it entirely, and as such, there are several sites in the Shard where earth demons have been chained, buried, or even encased in hardening shells of molten stone or metal. However, since Earth Demons have no real needs to meet in order to continue existing, they will struggle tirelessly against any prison that holds them, breaking free with the passage of time weakening their bonds. 

Most earth demons are not as actively malicious as their cousins, so giving them a wide berth is a far more commonly utilized option than the planning, effort, manpower and expense that can go into sealing one away. Typically, when an earth demon is imprisoned, it is because it was on a path directly towards a large city or settlement.

However, this should not be construed to mean earth demons are friendly or reasonable. They will still kill and destroy without hesitation; they are just indisposed to altering their own plans to hasten the demise of mortal beings who they are already guaranteed to outlive. The exception to this is if an earth demon has a grudge to settle with a one or more beings who previously imprisoned it, in which case it is an implacable foe.
