Theoretically, void demons are immensely powerful denizens of another world, but unlike the other kinds of [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Intelligent Monsters/Demons/Demons\|Demons]], nobody has ever seen a Void Demon - not only has no mortal ever seen one, but neither have any [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Gods\|Gods]] or [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Demigods\|Demigods]]. 

There are several theories as to why this may be the case. One is that the extreme aspect of Void represented in the Void Demon is 'absolute stealth,' preventing any being from observing their presence. Another is that a creature so deeply tied to Void, the aspect of negation, would be paradoxical, immediately ending their own existence as soon as they were born. Still others believe that a Void Demon may erase the memories of those who witness it. Of course, it could be something else altogether...

In any case, all such explanations remain conjecture gathered from observations of the symmetry of the other four types of demon.
