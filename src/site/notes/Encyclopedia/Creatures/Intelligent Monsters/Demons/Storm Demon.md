As with all [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Intelligent Monsters/Demons/Demons\|Demons]], storm demons are immensely powerful denizens of another world, but luckily are exceedingly rare. Any demon encountered in the Shard is a hitchhiker from the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Infinite Garden\|The Infinite Garden]], though they originated in [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/Ancient Hell\|Ancient Hell]]. 

A storm demon's particular ability is *absolute presence.* Storm demons possess a form of limited omnipresence - they normally exist in an incorporeal state, wherein they can instantly change their location to any point in the sea or sky. While they cannot interact with the world around them in this state, they can still perceive from their location. Additionally, a storm demon can hear its name being spoken from anywhere in the Shard, and knows the location at which it was spoken.

When a storm demon wants to interact with the material world, it can assume its corporeal form. In this form, it loses its absolute presence, and it takes about ten seconds for it to discorporate again. It can fly at great speeds, and possesses great finesse and acuity.

Storm demons are generally the most talkative and mortal-like of the known types of demon, though this should not be taken to mean that they are less malicious. Storm demons are often mercurial and sadistic, abusing their leverage as incredible spies and informants to blackmail those who entreat them.
