Nuriliths are a race which combines a humanoid torso with a bulky, grub-like lower body. As their name suggests, they were created by the [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Demigods\|demigoddess]] [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Nur\|Nur]] as one of the Pactborn: One of the promises that [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht]] made to the demigods before he stole the Shard was that they could each design a race of mortal followers, crafted to their liking. In reality, only the Nuriliths, the [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Metanulks\|Metanulks]], and the [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Oklin/Agkurha\|Agkurha]] were finished before the mad god was interred in [[Encyclopedia/Locations/The Worldseat\|The Worldseat]]. 

The nuriliths take after their matron in more than just name, however: their physiology and even much of their psychology was based on Nur herself. Nur had a love for food, even back then, so she gifted the Nuriliths multiple stomachs that can digest nearly any organic matter. Nur thought herself shrewd, so she gifted the Nuriliths a resourceful and acquisitive mind. Nur was so intent on recreating her own image, she made her daughters well over triple the size of her sons, so they wasted fewer resources on beings she couldn't see herself as. She was not modest in her intentions. 

Similarly, an average Nurilith is not a modest creature. Male Nuriliths are not even small, but rather, females are absolutely massive - an *average* Nurlith woman weighs more than a horse, and it's not terribly difficuly to find an individual that is twice that large or more. Their six short, stumpy legs, while ploddingly slow, do well in supporting their mass.

One of the more odd traits of this race is their ability to vomit sticky acid at a distance. One of their many stomachs is adapted to always fill with this clinging corrosive, which they can expel at moderate ranges.

As a young race, Nuriliths largely integrated into the existing societies and cultures of the Shard. Small numbers of them can be found all over the shard, though their physiology cannot abide arid or freezing environments. Most commonly, they take up roles as merchants, financiers, or managers in urban centers; social positions which they've earned very quickly considering the lack of inherited resources. Due to their excellent vision in darkness, they are also amongst the races that may live comfortably in the Shard's [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/Underpaths\|Underpaths]].
