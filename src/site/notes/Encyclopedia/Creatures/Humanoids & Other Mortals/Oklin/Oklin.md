Oklin are a family of humanoid races defined by having two distinct biological castes: a small Goblin caste which is the default for new adults, and a hulking Orc caste. Under certain conditions, an adult Goblin Oklin will begin to transform into the Orcoid form. This transformation is called orcinization.

In prehistoric Oklin societies, orcinization was linked to environmental factors like availability of food, and social dominance. In modern Oklin cultures, however, the triggers have been all but mastered, and individuals are selected to be orcinized using criteria that vary by culture.

It is technically possible for an Orc Oklin to revert back to their Goblin state, but this requires constant use of [[Game Rules/Magic/Blood/Metamorphosis (discipline)\|metamorphic]] magic over a long period of time. It is expensive, and rarely ever done.
