Orogi, also known as 'Tiger orcs' due to their patterned skin, are a species of [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Oklin/Oklin\|Oklin]] common in many areas of the Shard. They are especially prevalent in the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/3rd ring\|3rd Ring]], and are the predominant race in the [[Encyclopedia/Organizations/Nation-states/Orogi Inner Legions\|Orogi Inner Legions]]. An Orogi can be born with an affinity for any element, but affinities to [[Game Rules/Magic/Storm/The Sphere of Storm\|The Sphere of Storm]], [[Game Rules/Magic/Radiance/The Sphere of Radiance\|The Sphere of Radiance]], and [[Game Rules/Magic/Blood/The Sphere of Blood\|The Sphere of Blood]], are the most common. Affinity with [[Game Rules/Magic/Earth/The Sphere of Earth\|The Sphere of Earth]] is less common, and affinity with [[Game Rules/Magic/Void/The Sphere of Void\|The Sphere of Void]] is very rare, but still possible.

As with most humanoids, Orogi have a conventional pregnancy and give birth to live young. Their traits are passed down through genes, and magic typically plays no part in their reproductive cycle.

Young Orogi reach physical adulthood some time around their 15th year, though when they are considered legally adults varies by culture. Average adult height is two to two-and-a-half meters. Despite being Oklin, all Orogi transition to the orcoid form during puberty - there are no goblinoid Orogi. Trained Orogi of either sex are highly muscular.

Orogi have particularly thick, fast-growing hair, causing many Orogi to simply wear long braids or dreadlocks. Males can grow beards on the chin, but never mustaches or sideburns. Hair color is typically black, but can also come in dark reds, dark blues, and dark purples. Eye color is extremely variable.

Orogi are known for their distinctively striped skin - thus earning the common nickname 'Tiger Orcs'. Skin can be lime green, ashen, tan, brown, pinkish-red, vibrant red, flame orange, mauve, turquoise, or blue-gray. Their markings are typically a darker variant of the primary skin color, though sometimes the markings are nearly or completely black.
