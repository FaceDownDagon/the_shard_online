More commonly known as Thornhides, Agkurha are one of the Pactborn races: One of the promises that [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht]] made to the demigods before he stole the Shard was that they could each design a race of mortal followers, crafted to their liking. In reality, only the [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Nuriliths\|Nuriliths]], the [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Metanulks\|Metanulks]], and the Agkurha were finished before the mad god was interred in [[Encyclopedia/Locations/The Worldseat\|The Worldseat]]. The Agkurha were [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Jagrith\|Jagrith's]] contribution to this pact.

Agkurha were formed from an [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Humanoids & Other Mortals/Oklin/Oklin\|Oklin]] base, and both goblin and orc forms exist. Both forms share a few notable features, however. The first is a thick, rust-colored skin with rough, spiked protrusions. Additionally, the inside of an Agkurha's mouth is luminous with inner fire, giving them another moniker: Glowtongues. While useful at times, the bright light can prove a nuisance when hunting, so sign language is common amongst Agkurha orcs, who perform the hunting. This same inner fire manifests when they bleed, sending out a gout a flame that instantly cauterizes the wound.

Agkurha haven't spread terribly far from their origin at Jagrith's lair, and are mostly limited to the badlands and desert around it. They're well-adapted to this, as they are insensitive to heat, and lose very little water.

Within their society, orcinization is performed on young males who pass a series of trials. It is forbidden to discuss the exact content of the trials, but they test survival skills, combat ability, and moral character. The trials are designed to be difficult enough that only a few participants will succeed. Female Agkurha typically are orcinized via marriage to an orc, but the trials are theoretically open to them as well - however, participation is only expected for the males.
