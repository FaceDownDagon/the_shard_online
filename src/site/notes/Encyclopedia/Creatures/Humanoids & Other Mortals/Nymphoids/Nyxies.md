Nyxies are an all-female race of nymphs most known for their unusual method of reproduction: Nyxie mothers use gemstones to procreate. These stones influence the traits of the children, and become incorporated into the forehead of every adult Nyxie.

Aside from this, the appearance of a Nyxie is mostly a stark monochrome: white skin, black hair, and pure white eyes with black markings around them, which often extend to other parts of the face. These markings are unique to each individual, though their general characteristics are related to the Nyxie's birth stone. It is also common for the hair and/or skin to opalesce with various undertones, usually corresponding to the color of their stone.

Nyxies are strongly aligned with [[Game Rules/Magic/Void/The Sphere of Void\|The Sphere of Void]]. They are the sole amongst the mortal races that can consume magic directly for sustenance, though they are less dedicated to this strategy than the magivores of the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/1st ring\|1st ring]] - Nyxies still can and must eat normal food, as going without it for more than about a month causes a wasting sickness. However, perhaps due to their relation to gemstones, Nyxies can also create [[Encyclopedia/Objects/Materials/Mage-glass\|Mage-glass]] using spells in the [[Game Rules/Magic/Earth/Construction (discipline)\|Construction discipline]] of the [[Game Rules/Magic/Earth/The Sphere of Earth\|The Sphere of Earth]], despite their void-aligned magic. They cannot, however, use other Earth spells, nor shift stone or soil.

While Nyxies do inherit some traits from their mothers, they are just as affected by the traits of the gemstone used to birth them. This includes not only the type of stone, but also the size, cut, purity, and even slight variations in color. However, the stone type is the largest factor amongst these. 

There are three primary Nyxie populations across different cultures, so there is no singular agreement on how birth stones ought to be obtained and prepared, or even which are most desirable. The largest population is in [[Encyclopedia/Nation-states/Wassay\|Wassay]], where hard stones like diamond are most preferred, as stones are recovered from the fallen and passed on for rebirth. Sapphire and amethyst mines in [[Encyclopedia/Nation-states/Suddebrach\|Suddebrach]] and [[Encyclopedia/Nation-states/Turonne\|Turonne]] respectively formed the nuclei that the other two populations formed around. Those stones are still the most common in their respective regions, though trade ensures a variety of choices.

Some of the mechanisms of stone inheritance are well-understood: Harder stones are linked to taller stature, stone color is linked to facial markings, and large stones are linked to pointed ears. Other alleged mechanisms range from credible to apocryphal: Do triangle cut gems bolster strength, or are young Nyxies who have one pushed to be warriors?
