Metanulks are an artificial race created by the [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Mad god]]. Metanulks are sexless constructs made primarily of of marble and bronze, often decorated with precious materials such as pearls, gold, or silver. As a personal vanity project of Golyaht, they are very elegant and shapely, and primarily served as servile clergy at shrines, leystones, and other structures from the early days of the Shard. While no new Metanulks have been made since then, many have persisted to the current day.

Metanulks are fully sentient, yet are often very rigid in their thinking. They were created by a narcissistic god to be the perfect servants, and many still meticulously follow the rituals of their old stations. Metanulks are typically hesitant to abandon their posts, and most who do so are motivated by disappointment in the failings of their creator and his goals.

As ageless beings, the typical Metanulk holds little value for time, instead chasing the ideal of perfection. Simple actions are practiced hundreds of thousands of times. Floors and walls are cleaned and polished to a mirror-shine. A metanulk assigned to craft something as simple as spoons might spend months, or even years on every single item.

While this tendency has lessened slightly in some individuals over time, it is nonetheless present to some extent in every Metanulk. It leads to superb skills in a few narrow areas of focus, but even individuals who are willing to make the leap to abandon their old posts are notoriously slow to adapt. Nonethless, their unique physiology, ancient knowledge, and hyper-proficient  abilities are enticing enough to be sought by many mortal employers.

In modern times, scattered individual Metanulks can be found across many nations, but it is typically in the [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/6th ring\|6th ring]] that "faithful" Metanulks can still be found in the preserved ruins of buildings from the early years of the Shard.
