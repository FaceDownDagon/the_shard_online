Hazewreaths are a type of dryads named for the psychoactive pollen 'haze' they exude. This haze causes lethargy, confusion, warmth, and dreaminess, though the effects of a passive dose are quite mild. A hazewreath can, however, force a directed burst of pollen to amplify the effect, up to full-on delirium. In theory, this is a defense mechanism, but in practice, there are many who willingly pay for such a treatment.

A hazewreath possesses a slender, vine-like body, with pale, green-white skin. Downturned, urn-shaped flowers adorn her head in long strings. Like most dryads, Hazewreaths do not have a sex in the animal sense, even though appearing outwardly female. Though they produce pollen year-round, they can only receive pollen from other Hazewreaths in spring, after remaining outdoors in the rain the day before. This causes them to produce hard seeds the size of quail eggs, which the individual will either discard, store, or personally tend until the sprouts are ready to unroot and become mobile as children.

Though an individual Hazewreath can roam, since they can only reproduce in region with proper weather and soil conditions, their race is strongly centered on the humid highlands of the western [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/3rd ring\|3rd ring]] - mostly in the [[Encyclopedia/Nation-states/Orogi Inner Legions\|Orogi Inner Legions]], {Clanfall?}, and [[Encyclopedia/Nation-states/Suddebrach\|Suddebrach]].
