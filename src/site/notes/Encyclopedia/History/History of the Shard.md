In time immemorial, there was no such thing as "the Shard." In those days, all were part of [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Infinite Garden\|the Infinite Garden]]. The prime goddess [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Azamathra\|Azamathra]] was generous and benevolent to all her people, and was loved and worshipped in return. 

But not all was well. Jealous of the adulation that mortals slathered upon his mother, yet withheld from him, the goddess' 11th son [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht]] made a plan: Steal a piece of the world, and hide it away. Become the supreme deity of the land, and reap the praises of its inhabitants.

So, he gathered up six willing [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Demigods\|demigods]] as accomplices, and tore what would become [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Shard\|the Shard]] into the void. He wove a [[Encyclopedia/Locations/Great Veil\|Great Veil]], a curtain of deific power to separate this new reality from the old. This new reality, this world-pocket, is the Shard.

Golyaht and his demigods set about to maintain and manage their new world; to prosper mortals and to accrue worship. For a time, the Shard flourished, at least outwardly. There were grumblings amongst the mortals. Most of them had not wanted to be taken here, but they had not been given a warning, nor a choice. They grieved that they may never again see their friends, their families, or their goddess. Undeterred by this, Golyaht claimed the title of Worldfather, and decreed that temples be built in his name. This exacerbated the division, and behind his back, many would call Golyaht the "Usurper god."

A being of vanity, Golyaht lashed back. Blessings were reserved only for the obedient. Though possessed of immense power, his juvenile mind thought that the people he had claimed were as unruly children who would soon seek his forgiveness in the face of hardship. It instead had the opposite effect, galvanizing developing ideas of resistance.

Golyaht's resentment built to anger, until one day, when passing a village that was burning an image of him, he decided to make an example - in a spectacularly brutal fashion. Homes were reduced to ash. Walls were ripped from the ground and smashed to gravel. Defiant tongues were torn out. Blood flew, flesh tore, and bones shattered. Even the ground was gouged by his fury. 

Ever self-assured, he believed with this display of divine destruction, the rest of his mortals would realize the hopelessness of resistance. 

Instead, upon hearing of the massacre, cults began to spring up in opposition to the usurper god. Tensions rose, and the deity began to become more and more unhinged. He became obsessed with loyalty, demanding more and more extreme displays of devotion from those who still followed him. He rooted out and slaughtered those he perceived as against him, for pettier and pettier 'crimes.' As paranoia gripped him, Golyaht's final and most well-known epithet emerged: He was the 'Mad god.'

While mortals had little recourse in the face of the mad god's increasingly demented wrath, there was another revolt brewing. The six demigods Golyaht had brought under him for this scheme were disillusioned with the world they had supported. The Shard was unlike the Infinite Garden from which is had been torn: it was limited and lacking. Necessary features had been lost, and their substitutes were temporary workarounds that relied on constant maintenance to function. Seas had leaked off the torn edges of the land, so they had to enclose the Shard in a stone barrier. There was no sun, so a huge dome studded with light-crystals was erected in its stead. Many more subtle problems, too, relied on the [[Encyclopedia/Locations/Leylines\|leylines]] created to channel Golyaht's energy, which the demigods built and maintained.

They couldn't go back, though. They were isolated behind the Great Veil - a barrier meant to stave off the prime goddess, much less beings such as themselves. The mad god who could tear it down was also the source of their troubles. Some feared that without his power, the leylines would go dark, and the Shard would starve and die. Others thought that the death of the god was the only way to peace. The debate raged, but eventually, a compromise was made: Subdue the mad god. Entomb him in the center of the Shard, imprisoned and asleep. Let his dreaming power sustain their world, and never allow him to awaken. 

It was agreed, and the plan was put into action. Two years passed, as all spirits and mortals raged against their god together in the [[Encyclopedia/History/War of Entombment\|War of Entombment]]. The price was great - but at the end of it all, Golyaht lie beaten. The spell was woven, and his unconscious body was sealed in the great pillar at the center of the Shard - [[Encyclopedia/Locations/The Worldseat\|The Worldseat]].

The plan worked, but the full cost of their actions could not have been guessed by mortal or spirit. The mad god's power did flow, but even his dreams were stained with hate and betrayal. He sustained life...and twisted it. Succor was mixed with nightmares and monsters. That land nearest to the Worldseat became a distorted realm of bloated, vile flora, and spiteful, gnarled creatures possessed with malice. The lands farther out were less affected, in both aspects. The farthest reaches of the Shard became little more than barren wastes, unable to support life nor magic. 

Yet, mortal life eked on, adapting to their broken home. The six Demigods quarreled and bickered about how now to proceed, but with no great threat at hand, they could not agree, each coping with their world and now-prison in their own way. Perhaps it shall always be so, until comes the end of the Shard.
