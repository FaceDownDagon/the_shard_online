In time immemorial, there was no such "the Shard." In thise days, all were part of paradise; [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Infinite Garden\|the Infinite Garden]]. The goddess [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Azamathra\|Azamathra]] was generous and benevolent to all her people, and was loved and worshipped in return. This didn't sit well with one of her sons, [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht]]. Jealous of the adulation that mortals slathered upon his mother, he made a plan: Steal a piece of paradise, and hide it away. Surely when he was the highest deity in the land, he would get the praise he deserved! So, he gathered up six willing [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Demigod\|demigods]] as accomplices, and tore what would become [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Shard\|the Shard]] into the void. He wove a [[Encyclopedia/Locations/Great Veil\|Great Veil]], a curtain of deific power to separate this new reality from the old. This new reality, this world-pocket, is the Shard.

Golyaht and his demigods set about to maintain and manage their new world; to prosper mortals and to accrue worship. For a time, the Shard flourished, at least outwardly. There were grumblings amongst the mortals. Many of them had not chosen to be taken here. They grieved that they may never again see their friends, their families, their Goddess. So when Golyaht claimed the title of Worldfather, and decreed that temples must be built in his name, some instead gave him another title: "Usurper." A being of vanity, Golyaht lashed back. Blessings were reserved only for the obedient. The rest would scrape by on the dregs of his glorious lordship, and soon would return to the fold, he thought. They did not. Jealousy turned to anger, and one day, when passing a village that was burning an image of him, Golyaht snapped. He set an example, turning homes to charcoal, charcoal to dust, and dust to spiteful memories. He assumed that with such a display, the rest of his mortals would fall in line. They did not. Hearing of the massacre, cults began to spring up in opposition to the 'Mad God.' Tensions rose, and the deity began to become more and more unhinged. He slaughtered the ungrateful, while demanding more and more extreme displays of loyalty from those who still followed him. It was never enough for the Mad God to be feared; he wanted praise. But praise does not come at the tip of the lash, and the situation began to spiral out of control.

While mortals had little recourse in the face of the mad god's increasingly demented wrath, there was another revolt brewing. The six demigods Golyaht had brought under him for this scheme were disillusioned with the world they had supported. Yet, there was a problem. For all his faults, the mad god was still the only deity in the Shard. Some feared that without his power, they would be unable to sustain their world - and tearing the Great Veil, a barrier meant to stave off the prime Goddess, was simply not feasible. Others thought that the death of the god was the only way to peace. The debate raged, but eventually, a compromise was made. Subdue the Mad God. Entomb him in the center of the Shard, imprisoned and asleep. Let his dreaming power flow from that place, and never allow him to awaken. It was agreed, and the plan was put into action. Two years passed, as all spirits and mortals raged against their god together. The price was great - but at the end of it all, Golyaht lie beaten. The spell was woven, and his unconscious body was sealed in the great pillar at the center of the Shard - [[Encyclopedia/Locations/The Worldseat\|The Worldseat]].

The plan worked, but the full cost of their actions could not have been guessed by mortal or spirit. The Mad God's power did flow, but even his dreams were stained with hate and betrayal. He sustained life...and twisted it. Succor was mixed with nightmares and monsters. That land nearest to the Worldseat became a distorted realm of bloated, vile flora, and spiteful, gnarled creatures possessed with malice. The lands farther out were less affected, in both aspects. The farthest reaches of the Shard became little more than barren wastes, unable to support life nor magic. Yet, mortal life eked on, adapting to their broken home. The six Demigods quarreled and bickered about how now to proceed, but with no great threat at hand, they could not agree, each coping with their world and prison in their own way. And so has it been, and so shall it be, until comes the end of the Shard.
