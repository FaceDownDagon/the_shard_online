Ichorite is a rare, superior metal made by alloying [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Golyaht\|Golyaht's]] ichor into steel. This creates a metal which is hard, lightweight, and inured to corrosion, but more interestingly, inherits a caustic toxin which will be ever-present in the blade. This toxin is not merely anti-biological, but can oxidize other materials as well, helping Ichorite weapons 'bite' into steel armor.

Weapons made from Ichorite gain an additional +1 bonus to damage rolls. If damage is dealt to a living target this way, and the [[Game Rules/Gear/Weapon keywords\|damage mode]] was not thrusting, spiked, or cutting, deal an additional point of [[Game Rules/Combat/Damage types\|Bleed]] damage.
