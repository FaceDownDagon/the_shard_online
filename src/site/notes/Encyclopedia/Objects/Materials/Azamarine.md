Azamarine is a rare, superior metal which was only created by [[Encyclopedia/Creatures/Deities and Demigods/Azamathra\|Azamathra]] in the era before the Shard was separated from [[Encyclopedia/Atlas (Regions)/The Infinite Garden\|The Infinite Garden]]. As such, the supply of Azamarine in the Shard is finite, and will never increase. For this reason, it is common to search ruins for any remaining Azamarine objects.

Azamarine objects 'remember' their shape, and will gradually self-repair over time. Changing this shape can only be accomplished by 'alignment': a magical process in which the metal is 'instructed' to take a different form.

Azamarine weapons and armor will also 'bristle' when used in combat, pushing a dense cluster of metal spines or thorns into a struck foe, or at an incoming attack. This is thought to be related to the wielder's perception, as untended Azamarine objects do not exhibit this behavior.
