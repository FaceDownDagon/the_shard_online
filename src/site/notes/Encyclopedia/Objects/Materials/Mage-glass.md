Mage-glass is a transient crystal lattice which can be created by spells in the [[Game Rules/Magic/Earth/Construction (discipline)\|Construction discipline]] of [[Game Rules/Magic/Earth/The Sphere of Earth\|The Sphere of Earth]]. It is hard, partially translucent, and brittle. It evaporates into raw magical energy rapidly upon shattering, or gradually if left intact. Despite this impermanence, it is useful for Earth-mages operating in areas where the local minerals are soft, loose, or absent.
